==== Bugfixes

// https://jira.faktorzehn.de/browse/LIN-3319
===== Sanitization of HTML content

Using `@UILabel` with `htmlContent = true` previously did not sanitize the content. To make the behaviour of `htmlContent = true` more secure by default, the HTML is now automatically sanitized, removing potentially dangerous tags and attributes. Note that the `img` tag is whitelisted.

The same applies to `org.linkki.core.vaadin.component.base.LinkkiText` when using HTML content mode (`setText(..., true)`).

[WARNING]
==== 
When user-supplied strings are included in HTML content, they have to be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML. This can be achieved by using `HtmlSanitizer#escapeText`.
