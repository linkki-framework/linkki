=== Version 2.1.0

==== New features and improvements

===== Additional Behavior in `BindReadOnlyBehavior` displays buttons only in read-only mode
////
https://jira.faktorzehn.de/browse/LIN-2626
////
The <<bind-read-only-behavior,`@BindReadOnlyBehavior`>> annotation has been extended by the option `INVISIBLE_IF WRITABLE`. 
With this option, it is now possible to show buttons only in read-only mode. 
For more information see chapter <<bind-read-only-behavior,`@BindReadOnlyBehavior`>>.

===== Collapsible columns
////
https://jira.faktorzehn.de/browse/LIN-2138
////
With Vaadin 8, the property <<collapsible-columns, `collapsible`>> in the annotation `@UITableColumn` could be used to create a menu with which the user can toggle the visibility of a column. This menu was only visible on hover, and appeared on the right top corner of the table. 

As the reimplemented table in Vaadin Flow dropped support for the feature, the support of the `collapsible` property of `@UITableColumn` was also reduced. In the previous version, only the option `INITIALLY_COLLAPSED` had an effect. Any column with this option was simply not visible at all.

With this version, the feature of collapsible columns is supported again in linkki, however only for tables created inside of a section using `@UISection`. The new column selection menu is now always visible, greatly improving the usability of this feature. 


===== Sortable columns
////
https://jira.faktorzehn.de/browse/LIN-3015
////

Table columns created using `@UITableColumn` can now be made sortable using the property <<sortable-columns, `sortable`>>. The type of the column value must implement `Comparable`, which defines the order in which the values are sorted.
Note that model bindings cannot be used with sortable columns, a getter method must be used instead.

For more information, see "<<ui-table-column, @UITableColumn>>".

===== UIDateTimeField
////
https://jira.faktorzehn.de/browse/LIN-2295
////
A new annotation, `@UIDateTimeField`, has been added for selecting both a date and a time. `@UIDateTimeField` has all the properties of `UIDateField` and the property `step` for setting the time interval in the time picker overlay.

For more information, see "<<ui-datetimefield, @UIDateTimeField>>".

===== Dynamic item captions in combo boxes
////
https://jira.faktorzehn.de/browse/LIN-2855
////
Sometimes, the caption of an item in a combo box can change even if the item itself remains the same. To support this, a combo box used to not only update on item changes, but also checks the captions and update the items if any caption has changed. This additional check makes combo box less responsive to user interaction, especially if the combo box has many available values.

IMPORTANT: Considering the fact that the above mentioned feature is only required in relative rare cases, we decided to drop this feature for `@UIComboBox` by default. Combo boxes that require this feature can use the new annotation <<ui-combobox-dynamicCaption, `BindComboBoxDynamicItemCaption`>>. This annotation would update all items including their captions upon changes.
