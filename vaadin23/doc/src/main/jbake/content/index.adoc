*linkki* is an open source web framework to build great looking business
applications in pure Java with minimal effort.

== When to use

*linkki* might be the perfect fit for you if you have the following
requirements:

* You have UI pages that have to reflect a large domain model with complex business logic.
* You don't want to spend too much time and effort in the development of
the UI. This is often the case if the application tries to fully
automate processing, leaving the UI only for those use cases that
require manual interaction by back-office staff.
* You prefer to code both domain logic and UI in Java.

You can use *linkki* with plain Java, with https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot],
Spring inside an application server or JEE.

== Conceptual Overview

=== Domain Model

*linkki* is a framework to build the UI layer for a business application.
The only assumption about the business layer is that you use a domain
(entity) model to capture the structure of the business data.

=== Vaadin

*linkki* is a server side framework that can support different UI frameworks. Therefore it is divided into an UI framework independent core and UI framework specific modules like `linkki-core-vaadin14`. Linkki's core module is UI framework independent, but it needs a UI framework specific implementation to work. We offer such implementations based on https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin], which allows you to write UI in Java. The layouts and widgetsets are provided by Vaadin. It also handles the whole communication between the browser and the server.

However, the code has only very few direct dependencies to Vaadin API when using *linkki*. Most of the interaction with Vaadin is encapsulated by *linkki*.

*linkki* currently only supports https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/overview[Vaadin version 14].

=== Sections
The fundamental building blocks for a *linkki* UI are sections. A section is
defined as a group of related (input) fields/controls. For example, a section
might contain the data about a person such as name and date of birth. The fields
for the address such as country, city and street might be grouped together in
another section. *linkki* provides standard layouts for the sections to
give the UI a consistent look and to speed up your development. The following
screenshot shows the two mentioned example sections.

=== Annotated Presentation Model Objects

Presentation model objects (aka view model) as explained by Martin
Fowler are used to provide data for the UI and to process data changed in the
UI. To put it simple, you can write one PMO for each section when using *linkki*.
Section PMOs are annotated with annotations that define how a section looks. At runtime, *linkki* creates the (Vaadin) layouts and controls based on
the annotations.

The following is the PMO code for the partner data section shown above.

=== Data binding

To move the data from the UI controls through your PMOs to the domain
model and back, *linkki* provides a data binding mechanism.

Each time the user changes the data in a field, *linkki* calls the
appropriate setter method in the PMO. For example if the user changes
the person's name, `setName(newName)` is called. In the same way, `getName()`
provides the name displayed in the control. The following diagram
illustrates the interaction between User Interface and Business Layer.

=== Straight through data binding

In the sample code above, the PMO reads and updates the domain model. As
you can see, the code is already repetitive with only two fields. To reduce
the overhead in code, *linkki* allows you to bind the controls directly to
properties in the domain model if you don't need to apply any transformation
or calculation to the displayed data. The following is a shorter
`PartnerSectionPmo` which uses the above explained *linkki* feature.

include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/doc/modelbinding/PartnerSectionPmo.java[tags=pmo]
----

Instead of the getter and setter method you just need to write a placeholder
method and declare the attribute/property name in the annotation.
Additionally, you have to provide an annotated method that returns the model
object. *linkki* then binds the controls directly to the domain model. The
mechanism also supports more than one model object per section.

=== Binding all properties defining visual behavior

*linkki* is not only able to bind field values to PMO properties but can also bind
other typical aspects such as enabled state, visible state and the available values
shown in a combo box. In fact, all properties of a UI control can be bound this way.

To demonstrate this, we extend our previous example: A partner might now be either a
person or a company. The date of birth field should then only be enabled for persons. Here is the new section and the code for enabling the date of birth field depending on the type of person.

include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/doc/dynamic/PartnerSectionPmo.java[tags=dynamic]
----

In the date of birth annotation, the `enabled` attribute specifies that the
enabled state of the control should change dynamically. *linkki* uses a naming
convention to find the method that calculates the dynamic state. In this case,
the calculation is done in the method `isDateOfBirthEnabled()`.

=== Well-structured UI Code

UI code written using *linkki* has a very clear structure. Each section
is defined by one PMO. If you name your PMO classes after the section
headlines, you can find the relating code of any given section in seconds even
 if you are unfamiliar with the code base.

=== Testable UI logic

PMOs are plain old Java objects. Except for *linkki* annotations, they
don't need any dependency to infrastructure code. So it is very simple
and straightforward to write tests for your PMOs.

== What else?

There is a lot more that helps you to build a whole business application such as:

* Simple API to create tables with dynamic content
* Automatic highlighting of inputs based on validation logic defined in the business layer
* Support of PMO based creation of sections in dialogs
* An overall application layout with an application menu
