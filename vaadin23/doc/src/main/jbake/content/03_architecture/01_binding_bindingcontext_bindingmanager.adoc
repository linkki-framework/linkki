=== Binding, BindingContext, BindingManager

For each UI component bound to a PMO property, *linkki* creates a so called `Binding`. The methods of this `Binding` ensure that subsequent changes in the PMO lead to an update of the UI component, and vice versa.

.Binding, Binding Context

All `Bindings` in *linkki* are part of a `BindingContext`. Typically, a `BindingContext` contains all `Bindings` of a page or a section. Changes to a bound object (PMO or UI component) trigger an update of all `Bindings` in the same context. A single `BindingContext` can contain `Bindings` linked to different PMOs.

To manage `BindingContexts`, a `BindingManager` is used. The most important task of a `BindingManager` is to provide validation across all managed `BindingContexts`, as input changes in one `BindingContext` may lead to validation problems in others. For that, a <<validation-service, ValidationService>> is invoked upon changes in any of the managed `BindingContexts`. The result is then propagated to the other `BindingContexts` for display.

In addition to the validation, `BindingManager` also provides methods to create `BindingContexts` with default values that apply to all managed `BindingContexts`. A `BindingContext` can either be created using only a name that is used as an identifier, or additionally with a `PropertyBehaviorProvider` that defines a specific set of <<property-behavior, behaviors>>. A `Class` can also be passed as an alternative to be used a identifier.

==== The scope of UI updates

A `BindingContext` ensures that all contained `Bindings` are updated if one of them changes. The `Bindings` in turn update their respective UI fields. Thus, a `BindingContext` defines the "scope" of UI updates for its fields.

It is common practice to use a `BindingContext` for all fields visible to the user at a time. For example a single `BindingContext` for a big form. On the other hand, if there are multiple tab sheets it's best to use a separate `BindingContext` for each of them, as only one of the tabs is visible at a time. This avoids unnecessary updates of fields that aren't even visible.

The `BindingManager` is responsible for everything that is beyond that aspect of currently visible fields. For example the input of data on one tab sheet may result in a validation violation on another tab sheet. Hence <<validation,validation>> is part of the `BindingManager`.

[[uiupdateobserver]]
==== UiUpdateObserver

If UI components depend on information inside a different `BindingContext`, a `UiUpdateObserver` can be used to ensure updates are triggered when the referenced content changes. The `UiUpdateObserver` is attached to a `BindingManager`, which calls the `uiUpdated()` method each time a UI update occurs (e.g. when a `BindingContext` belonging to the `BindingManager` updates). Since the class `BindingContext` implements `UiUpdateObserver`, it can be directly added as such. Using this mechanism, UI created by *linkki* would be updated with every change inside the same `BindingManager`.

A possible use case might look like this: A `TabSheetArea` consists of several tab sheets with each using its own, separate `BindingContext`. This ensures that a change to the currently visible tab is propagated to other fields inside the same tab, while not affecting non-visible fields contained in different tabs to improve performance. These updates can freely be skipped, since a tab sheet's `BindingContext` always receives an update when the tab is selected and becomes visible.

Adding a permanently visible summary section (referencing data from multiple tab sheets) to the page would require an update whenever a change is made to an arbitrary `BindingContext`. Otherwise, it would display outdated data since changes of referenced data are not propagated. This can be achieved by adding the new section's `BindingContext` as a `UiUpdateObserver` to the `BindingManager` of the page.

[[after-model-changed-handler]]
==== Executing additional action after model update

Sometimes it is necessary to execute an action before each UI update that is triggered by a model change. This can be achieved by using the so called `afterModelChangedHandler` when creating a `BindingContext`. If this handler is set upon creation, it is called whenever a value is pushed to the model in a `BindingContext` before the UI is updated. 

==== Updating the UI explicitly

Sometimes, it is necessary to trigger an UI explicitly. The class `BindingContext` provides two methods to achieve that:

modelChanged::
  This method should be called by actions out of the `BindingContext` that result in a model change. The `BindingContext` will then update the `Bindings` as if a change happened inside of the `BindingContext`. +
  Example: Assuming the value of a field would be changed by a dialog that is in a different `BindingContext`. In that case, confirming the dialog should result in calling the method `modelChanged`.
updateUi::
  This method should be called by actions that do not change the model, but triggers an update of the UI. + 
  Example: When a tab sheet is switched to visible, the content needs to be updated to reflect the model. But no model changes are made by this action.
