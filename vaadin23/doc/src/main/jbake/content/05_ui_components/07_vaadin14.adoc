==== LinkkiTabLayout

A component that allows switching between different contents, using either a horizontal or vertical tab bar. Only a single tab can be active at a time.

This is a replacement for the linkki Vaadin 8 `SidebarSheet` and `TabSheetArea`.

===== Create Tabs

Tabs are added to the layout using a `LinkkiTabSheet`. The tab sheet is created using a builder:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/doc/tab/TabSheetExample.java[tags=createTabSheet]
----

To create a `LinkkiTabSheet` as sidebar layout, use `newSidebarLayout()`, and icons as captions. A description can also be provided which is displayed by hovering the mouse over the icon.

----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/doc/tab/TabSheetExample.java[tags=createSidebar]
----

===== Toggle Visibility of Tabs

A tab can be dynamically set to visible or invisible by providing a `BooleanSupplier` in the builder of `LinkkiTabSheet` using the method `visibleWhen(BooleanSupplier)`. The suppliers must return `true` to set the tab visible and `false` to set it invisible.

The method `LinkkiTabLayout#updateSheetVisibility()` must be triggered to update the visibility state. The method is automatically called by https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/routing/tutorial-routing-lifecycle#afternavigationevent[Vaadin's AfterNavigationEvent], that means the visibility state is at least updated when there is a navigation to the view containing the tabs.

===== Selection Change Events

There are several possibilities to receive a selection change event in case a new tab is selected. All events are also triggered for the auto-selection when the first tab is added to the tab layout.

Implement AfterNavigationObserver:: The recommended way is to implement the interface `AfterNavigationObserver` in the content layout. Any component that is part of the selected tab gets the event if it is attached and visible at the time the tab is selected.

Adding a listener to LinkkiTabLayout:: Use the method `addSelectedChangeListener(ComponentEventListener<SelectedChangeEvent>)` to get a `SelectedChangeEvent` containing the selected tab.

Adding a listener to LinkkiTabSheet:: It is also possible to add a listener directly to the `LinkkiTabSheet` using `addTabSelectionChangeListener(ComponentEventListener<TabSheetSelectionChangeEvent>)`. The returned `Registration` could be used to unregister the listener.

==== ComponentStyles
New utility class that offers several methods for styling UI components

* `setOverflowAuto(Component)`: Sets the overflow of the given `Component` to "auto". This makes the `Component` automatically scroll if necessary.
* `setFormItemLabelWidth(Component, String)`: Sets the width of all form item labels in the given `Component`.
