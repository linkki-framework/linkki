=== Notifications

Notifications can be created using `NotificationUtil`. It provides three types of notifications: info, warning and error.

Info and warning notifications close automatically after the configured time. Error notifications require the "Close" to be pressed.

==== MessageList
When displaying a `MessageList`, the severity of the notification is equal to the maximum severity in the `MessageList`. Additionally, each message has an icon corresponding to its individual severity.
