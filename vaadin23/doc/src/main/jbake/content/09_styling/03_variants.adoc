=== Variants of the linkki theme

linkki theme has several variants that can be used to customize all components. 

==== Variants 

Card section pages ("card-section-pages"):: Sections inside of all `AbstractPage` components have a card like design.

Compact ("compact"):: Smaller spaces for a more compact look.

The variant names are also available as constants in the class `LinkkiTheme`.

==== Applying a variant

In generall, theme variants can be added at runtime with `UI.getCurrent().getElement().getThemeList().add`.

When using <<application-layout, `ApplicationLayout`>>, default variants that should apply initially can be set in  <<default-variants, `ApplicationConfig`>>.

A toggle for theme variants can also be <<theme-variant-toggle-menu-item-definition, built into the application menu>>.
