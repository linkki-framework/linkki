=== Variants of the linkki theme

linkki theme has several variants that can be used to customize all components. 

==== Variants 

Card section pages ("card-section-pages"):: Sections inside of all `AbstractPage` components have a card like design.

Compact ("compact"):: Smaller spaces for a more compact look.

The variant names are also available as constants in the class `LinkkiTheme`.

==== Applying a variant

Just like the <<apply-linkki-theme, linkki Theme>>, the variant is also defined by the `AppShellConfigurator` with the annotation `@Theme`. The attribute `variant` should be set with the variant name. Multiple variants can be provided by combining the variant names in a space separated string.
