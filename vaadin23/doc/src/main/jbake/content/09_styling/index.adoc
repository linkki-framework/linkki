== Styling

The theming mechanism is provided by Vaadin. *Linkki* extends the default Lumo theme for additional functionalities of *linkki* components. Thus, the *linkki* theme must be applied to make sure the *linkki* components work correctly.

This chapter focuses on the application and customization of the *linkki* theme. More in-depth information on the theming mechanism can be found in the https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/ds/customization/using-themes[Vaadin documentation on themes].
