[[ui-tables]]
=== Tables

The basics of table creation were already mentioned in the chapter <<binding-table, binding of a table>>. This section details the <<ui-row-pmo,definition of table structure>> and the <<ui-container-pmo, Container PMO>>.

WARNING: For compatibility and performance reasons, *linkki* uses the Vaadin 7 `Table` implementation (from the Vaadin 7 compatibility layer included in Vaadin 8). 

[[ui-row-pmo]]
==== Definition of the Table Structure with a Row PMO
The structure of the table is defined in a PMO class, whose instances represent rows in the table. Thus, these classes are called "row PMOs".

Row PMO classes are standard PMOs, which do not represent sections and thus shouldn't be annotated with `@UISection`.

Here, the annotation <<ui-element,UI element>> defines the column in the table. A column showing the name of a contact, for instance, can be setup as follows:

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding}/org/linkki/samples/binding/pmo/ContactRowPmo.java[tags=contactRowPmo-labelBinding]
----

That means every property that was found in the row PMO class provided by the `ContainerPmo` is set up as a column. Every defined property specifies the setup of the column as well as the concrete field inside the table's cell. Next to all aspects that are provided by `@UITableColumn` it takes the label from the field definition.

IMPORTANT: The properties of a table column are described using the properties in the row PMO. But these properties cannot be bound to any specific row PMO instance (there might be none if the table is empty or many if there are multiple rows). Hence all bindings are directed to the row PMO class. That also means: If you want to <<nls-properties,translate a column label>> the key is created using the class name of the row PMO.

[[ui-table-column]]
===== @UITableColumn

By design all properties of a PMO are presented in the table. With the annotation `@UITableColumn` additional properties of a table column could be bound.

To modify the column size you could use the properties `width` (in pixels) or `expandRatio`.

NOTE: If both properties are set, an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown when the UI is constructed.

Additionally, with the property `collapsible`, you could specify a `CollapseMode` to let the column be collapsible or initially collapsed.

[[ui-container-pmo]]
==== Container PMO

In addition to a row PMO, a container PMO is needed to provide the row PMOs that should be rendered in the table. The container PMO can be optionally annotated with `@UISection` to display the table in a `TableSection`. For most cases, the standard implementation <<ui-simple-table-pmo,`SimpleTablePmo`>> can be used as super class.

[[ui-simple-table-pmo]]
===== SimpleTablePmo

Most commonly, the row PMO objects are converted from a list of model objects. In this case, the abstract class `org.linkki.core.defaults.columnbased.pmo.SimpleTablePmo<MO, ROW>` may be extended. It defines a constructor that requires the list or the supplier for the list of model objects. Additionally the method `createRow(MO)` needs to be implemented. This method simply takes a model object and creates a row PMO for it and is only called once for every model object. A simple example may look like this:

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding}/org/linkki/samples/binding/pmo/SimpleContactTablePmo.java[tags=simpleContactTablePmo]
----

The `SimpleTablePmo` is an abstract convenience implementation of the `ContainerPmo<ROW>` interface.

[[ui-container-pmo-interface]]
===== ContainerPmo Interface

In general, a container PMO have to implement the interface `ContainerPmo<ROW>`. The type parameter `ROW` is the row PMO class that defines the table structure.

The method `List<ROW> getItems()` is called by the `ContainerBinding` to add the elements to the table. It should always return the same instance of `List<ROW>` as long as the items do not change. The <<ui-simple-item-supplier, `SimpleItemSupplier`>> offers support for that.

By overriding the default method `int getPageLength()` the number of rows shown can be controlled. By default 15 rows are shown. It is a common tactic to allow tables to 'grow' to a certain size and then limit the number of lines while also enabling the scrolling for the table. If `0` is returned the table grows dynamically with the content, without limit.

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding}/org/linkki/samples/binding/pmo/ContactTablePmo.java[tags=page-length]
----

The column structure of the table is determined by the <<ui-row-pmo, row PMO>> class, which is returned by the method `Class<? extends ROW> getItemPmoClass`. In the default implementation the class of the generic parameter `ROW` is returned. To support tables which are configured with other components for the cells, the method can be overwritten and return a subclass of `ROW`.

If the table should support the adding of items, the `default` method `Optional<ButtonPmo> getAddItemButtonPmo` must be overwritten. How a `ButtonPmo` is created is described in the chapter <<button-pmo, ButtonPmo>>.

[[ui-simple-item-supplier]]
===== SimpleItemSupplier

The `SimpleItemSupplier<PMO, MO>` is used to only create a new `List<PMO>`, if a row was changed. When using `ContainerPmo` interface directly, `SimpleItemSupplier` should be used if the displayed rows may change dynamically.

The instantiating is done with two parameters

* `modelObjectSupplier` of type `Supplier<List<MO>>` is called to access a list of the model objects
* `mo2pmoMapping` of type `Function<MO, PMO>` is called for the creation of a PMO for a model object

[[ui-hierarchical-table]]
==== Hierarchical Tables

Sometimes, the data in a table should be grouped for presentation, for example when summarizing values over certain categories. In that case, the data represents a tree-like structure with parent-child-relationships between rows. The resulting table will be a Vaadin `TreeTable` which allows collapsing and showing the child-rows of a row.

.Hierarchical table
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/treetable.png[A hierarchical table,align="center"]

This can be realized by using `org.linkki.core.defaults.columnbased.pmo.HierarchicalRowPmo<PMO>`, row PMOs that contain further rows as children. It is possible to use multiple subclasses for row PMOs, using `HierarchicalRowPmo` only for collapsible rows. To indicate that the table contains hierarchical rows, the <<ui-container-pmo,ContainerPmo>> should return `true` in the method `isHierarchical()`. By default, this method returns `true` if `getItemPmoClass()` returns a class that implements `HierarchicalRowPmo`, which means that all rows are collapsible.

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir-treetable}/org/linkki/samples/treetable/fixed/pmo/SummarizingPersonRowPmo.java[tags=hierarchical-row-pmo]
----

If the order of the rows might change due to user input, you should use a <<ui-simple-item-supplier,`SimpleItemSupplier`>> as with the <<ui-container-pmo,`ContainerPmo`>> to avoid recreating the PMOs for unchanged rows.

[[ui-selectable-table]]
==== Row selection in Tables

By default, table rows are not selectable. If table row selection should be possible, the `ContainerPmo` implementation should also implement the interface `SelectableTablePmo`. This interface requires three methods:

* `ROW getSelection()`: returns the selected row
* `setSelection(ROW)`: sets the new selected row
* `onDoubleClick()`: executes action when a double click is made on the selected row. It is safe to assume that `setSelection(ROW)` is already called.

Note that it is not possible to nullify the selection once a row is selected.

[[ui-table-footer]]
==== TableFooterPmo

By overwriting the `default` method `getFooterPmo()` a footer row is generated. The implementation of the interface `TableFooterPmo` must implement the method `getFooterText(String column)`.

The parameter `column` is the ID of the column for which the text should be displayed. An example for this would be a sum of all items from a column.

[[button-pmo]]
==== ButtonPmo
Currently the <<ui-container-pmo, `ContainerPmo`>> provides a method `getAddItemButtonPmo()`, by which a plus button can be added besides the name of the table. This part of the API is being refactored in the issue LIN-128.
