=== 0.9.20190418

With this version, *linkki* now supports both Vaadin Framework 7 and Vaadin Framework 8. If you intend to use *linkki* with Vaadin Framework 8, we highly recommend migrating to the previous *linkki* version first as Vaadin Framework 8 includes several major changes that also leads to changes in the *linkki* API. Also, it is best to first free your project from deprecated warnings related to linkki. Although we tried our best to keep the API stable, some concepts had to be reworked fundamentally, making it impossible to carry the existing API over to the new version.



==== *linkki* for Vaadin Framework 8

Up to now, *linkki* could only be used with Vaadin Framework 7. Now, you can decide if you want to use *linkki* with Vaadin Framework 7 or Vaadin Framework 8. As Vaadin Framework 7 will not be maintained anymore in 2020, the development of *linkki* will be primarily focused on Vaadin 8 from now onwards.

Vaadin Framework 8 poses a large release containing major improvements and changes. If you want to use *linkki* with Vaadin Framework 8 but prefer a more granular migration process, you can first switch to *linkki* for Vaadin 7, then move forward to *linkki* for Vaadin 8 after having adjusted to the changes.

===== Migrating to *linkki* for Vaadin 7
endif::[]


Maven Dependency::
If you want to continue using *linkki* with Vaadin 7, you need to replace the *linkki* dependencies with the new *linkki* Vaadin 7 dependencies for `linkki-core` or `linkki-application-framework`:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<!-- Replacement for the existing linkki-core dependency -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.linkki-framework</groupId>
  <artifactId>linkki-core-vaadin7</artifactId>
  <version>{projectVersion}</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Replacement for the exsiting linkki-application-framework dependency -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.linkki-framework</groupId>
  <artifactId>linkki-application-framework-vaadin7</artifactId>
  <version>{projectVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----

Migration Script::
Alongside with the introduction of Vaadin 8 support for *linkki*, we needed to make some general changes in the core module, including a restructuring of the packages. To automate some of the migration steps, we created shell scripts to help with this update.
+
The migration scripts contain find and replaces commands that can be automatically applied. The find and replaces are defined in the files link:../migration_scripts/0.9.20190205_to_0.9.20190418/migrate-packages-core.sed[migrate-packages-core.sed] and link:../migration_scripts/0.9.20190205_to_linkkiVaadin8/componentdefinition.sed[componentdefinition.sed]. The script link:../migration_scripts/search_replace.sh[search_replace.sh] executes these commands.
+
The easiest way to use the migration script is to put both files in your project directory and run `"./search_replace.sh -s migrate-packages-core.sed"` followed by `"./search_replace.sh -s componentdefinition.sed"` in your terminal. The scripts can be executed in any terminal that supports shell scripts, including the git bash.
+
Some changes are not covered by the migration script. To deal with the remaining changes, if there are any in your project, you can inform about the changes in the section "<<general-changes,General Changes>>" that is below the Vaadin specific migration steps.

===== Migrating to *linkki* for Vaadin 8
endif::[]

Maven Dependency::
The very first step for the migration is to include the new *linkki* Vaadin 8 dependencies for `linkki-core` or `linkki-application-framework`:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<!-- Replacement for the existing linkki-core dependency -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.linkki-framework</groupId>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.linkki-framework</groupId>
  <artifactId>linkki-application-framework-vaadin8</artifactId>
  <version>{projectVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----

Migration Script::
To minimize the migration effort, we created shell scripts to help with the changes that can be easily automated.
+
The find and replaces are defined in the files link:../migration_scripts/0.9.20190205_to_0.9.20190418/migrate.sed[migrate.sed], link:../migration_scripts/0.9.20190205_to_0.9.20190418/migrate-packages-vaadin8.sed[migrate-packages-vaadin8.sed] and link:../migration_scripts/0.9.20190205_to_linkkiVaadin8/componentdefinition.sed[componentdefinition.sed].
The script link:../migration_scripts/search_replace.sh[search_replace.sh] executes these commands.
+
The easiest way to use the migration script is to put all the files in your project directory and run `"./search_replace.sh -s migrate.sed"` followed by `"./search_replace.sh -s migrate-packages-vaadin8.sed"` and  `"./search_replace.sh -s componentdefinition.sed"` in your terminal. The scripts can be executed in any terminal that supports shell scripts, including the git bash.

LinkkiConverterFactory::
The configuration of custom converters has changed. Instead of the existing `ConverterFactory`, a `LinkkiConverterRegistry` is now used in `ApplicationConfig`.
+
.Cooperating custom converters
[cols="a,a", options="header"]
|===
| Until Now | New
|
[source,java]
----
public class MyApplicationConfig implements ApplicationConfig {
  ...

  @Override
  public ConverterFactory getConverterFactory() {
      return new LinkkiConverterFactory(this::getConverters);
  }

  private Sequence<Converter<?, ?>> getConverters() {
      return LinkkiConverterFactory.DEFAULT_JAVA_8_DATE_CONVERTERS
              .with(new MyConverter());
  }
}
----
|
[source,java]
----
public class MyApplicationConfig implements ApplicationConfig {
  ...

  @Override
  public ConverterRegistry getConverterRegistry() {
      return LinkkiConverterRegistry.DEFAULT
              .with(new MyConverter());
  }
}
----
|===
+
This change is relevant for you if you have overriden `ApplicationConfig#getConverterFactory` to use custom converters with *linkki* default annotations.
+
Converters are necessary to make *linkki* UI annotations work for custom data types. By default, *linkki* UI annotations only work for a very specific data type. `@UIDateField` for example only works with Java Time `LocalDate`. If you want to use an annotation with a different data type, you have to provide a converter for the data type. To make the example annotation `@UIDateField` work with Joda `LocalDates`, a converter that transforms Joda `LocalDates` to Java Time `LocalDates` must be registered to the application.
+
Prior to this version, we directly utilized the Vaadin `ConverterFactory` mechanism to register converters. Several default converters were provided in `LinkkiConverterFactory` that is configured in the `ApplicationConfig`. There, you can also replace the `LinkkiConverterFactory` with a custom implementation to include your own converters.
+
In Vaadin Framework 8, the `ConverterFactory` mechanism is removed. Without a central registry, converters have to be bound to the input fields directly in Vaadin Framework 8. To mitigate this change for *linkki* users, *linkki* now has its own `LinkkiConverterRegistry`. Custom converters can directly be amended to the default converters by calling `LinkkiConverterRegistry.DEFAULT.with(...)`.

Joda Time Converters::
`ConverterFactory` was commonly used to incorporate Joda converters that were included in `JodaConverters`. *linkki* Vaadin 8 does not support Joda Time any more. If you are still using Joda Time, you now have to create the converters yourself. Vaadin's `LocalDateToDateConverter` can serve as a reference when building your own converter.

FieldValueAspectDefinition::
`FieldValueAspectDefinition` is renamed to `ValueAspectDefinition` which now handles converters and formatters that should be attached to a specific field annotation. Due to this change, it is no longer created by the  `FieldAspectDefinitionCreator` by default.

       TextField field = new TextField();
       field.setConverter(new MySpecialConverter());
       return field;
   }

   }

public class MyConverterValueAspectDefinitionCreator implements AspectDefinitionCreator<UiSpecialFieldWithConverter> {

  @Override
   public LinkkiAspectDefinition create(Annotation annotation) {
       return new ValueAspectDefinition(new MySpecialConverter());
   }
}

----
+
This change is necessary to comply with the new Vaadin mechanism for converters. Before the migration, converters and formatters that are specific for a UI annotation are added in the `newComponent` method of the `BindingDefinition` with `setConverter`. This is not possible anymore. Thus, the `ValueAspectDefinition` must take different converters into account depending on the annotation.
+
For all custom UI annotations that do not use any specific converters, you can simply add the aspect explicitly in a separate `@LinkkiAspect` annotation using the `ValueAspectDefinitionCreator`. If your custom UI annotations have previously added a  custom converter in the `newComponent` method of the `BindingDefinition`, you have to introduce a new `Creator` that creates a `ValueAspectDefinition` with the given converter. This also applies to number fields that have previously required a formatter.

Default spacing in layouts::
The default behavior considering spacing and margin has changed in Vaadin layouts. For the migration, make sure to double check all layouts to avoid unwanted spacing.
+
This change applies to all Vaadin ordered layouts, including `HorizontalLayout` and `VerticalLayout`. Spacing adds distance between elements in the layout while margins (which translate to CSS paddings) keep the elements away from the borders. These adjustments keep the elements apart from each other and from the border, making them more accessible and more readable. However, the extra space may not be desired if you are using the layouts as mere wrappers.
+
.Margin and spacing in Vaadin
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/margin_spacing.png[Margin and spacing in Vaadin]
+
Some *linkki* layouts are also reworked considering margins. Sections now have a smaller top margin while `AbstractPage` now has a padding inside of all borders as well as default spacing between the elements. These changes should make the spacing within an `AbstractPage` more consistent.
+
Sections that do not have a caption nor any header buttons had a spacer instead of the header. This spacer is removed in the new version as it is often not desired. If you wish to have extra space for a specific section, you can add a top margin in the SCSS theme by selecting the section using the PMO class name or the ID assigned by `@SectionId`.

image::{images}{images-folder-name}/headerless_section_vaadin8.png[Section with no header in linkki Vaadin 8]

Width of labels::
In Vaadin Framework 8, `Label` no longer have full width by default. If you have created any Vaadin `Label`, make sure to check the length of the label to avoid unnecessary changes. Labels that are created with a `@Label` annotation are not affected.

In addition to the changes above, there are also some general changes that apply to both Vaadin 7 and Vaadin 8 migration. These are listed below the Vaadin specific migration steps. Some of these changes are covered by the migration script. However, you should inform yourself about the changes to deal the any remaining problems that could not be fixed by the script.

Besides the changes in linkki, Vaadin Framework 8 itself comes with several API changes. To migrate your Vaadin native implementations, consult the https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/migration/migrating-to-vaadin8.html[Vaadin 8 Migration Guide]. Note that *linkki* uses the compatibility layer for Vaadin 7 to be able to use the Vaadin 7 `Table` component. However, other components from the compatibility layer will not work with `linkki-core-vaadin8`.

[[general-changes]]
==== General Changes

Regardless of which Vaadin version you intend to use, there are some general changes that were necessary to separate Vaadin specific implementations.

[role="api-change"]
===== Encapsulation of Vaadin specific implementations in `linkki-core`

To make *linkki* usable with different Vaadin versions, all Vaadin dependencies in `linkki-core` have been moved to Vaadin specific artifacts. Any uses of UI framework API from the core are now handled via the new `UiFramework` class. It is recommended that you also use it instead of directly calling Vaadin API where applicable. This especially apply to all `UiUtils.getUiLocale()` and `UI.getCurrent().getLocale()` calls.

.Methods of UiFramework
[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Until now | New | Notes
| `UiUtils.getUiLocale()`
`UI.getCurrent().getLocale()` | `UiFramework.getLocale()` | the locale defined for the UI session, may differ from the System locale
|===

[role="api-change"]
===== Introduction of *linkki* `Severity` for `Message` and `MessageList`

To make the *linkki* `Message` and `MessageList` independent of Vaadin, a new enum `Severity` is introduced to avoid using the Vaadin `ErrorLevel` directly. Consequently, several methods of `Message` and `MessageList` are changed, now using the new *linkki* `Severity`. Note that the existing methods are directly removed, as it is not possible to deprecate them due to direct Vaadin dependencies.

.API changes in org.linkki.core.message
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Until now | New | Notes
| `ErrorLevel` | `Severity` | A Vaadin independent enum indicating the kind of severity a message can have.
3+| *Message*
| `Message(String, String, ErrorLevel)` | `Message(String, String, Severity)` |
| `getErrorLevel` | `getSeverity` |
| `builder(String, ErrorLevel)` | `builder(String, Severity)` |
3+| *MessageList*
| `getErrorLevel` | `getSeverity` |
| `getFirstMessage(ErrorLevel)` | `getFirstMessage(Severity)` |
| `sortByErrorLevel` | `sortBySeverity` |
|===

===== UI Components
We generalized the creation of UI components in order to use the same machniasm to create both UI elements such as `UIComboBox` and UI layouts such as `UISection`.

As a consequence, if you have custom UI annotations in your project, you need to add additional annotations to them.

.Migration of custom UI annotations
[cols="a,a", options="header"]

| Until Now | New
|

@LinkkiPositioned // <3>
@LinkkiBindingDefinition(CustomAnnotationBindingDefinition.class)
public @interface UICustomAnnotation {

  @LinkkiPositioned.Position // <3>
  int position();
  ...
}
----
|===
<1> `@LinkkiComponent` is a new annotation that refers to a `ComponentDefinitionCreator`. This creator defines how the UI component is created. For `LinkkiBindingDefinitions` you can use the provided `BindingDefinitionComponentDefinition.Creator.class`.
<2> `@LinkkiBoundProperty` refers to a `BoundPropertyCreator`. A `BoundPropertyCreator` defines how to retrieve the name(s) of the presentation model object property and optionally the model object and model attribute from the annotation.
<3> `@LinkkiPositioned` and `@LinkkiPositioned.Position` mark the position of the UI element when it is added to a parent.

All these additional annotations allows you to create a custom UI annotation without using a `BindingDefinition`. `BindingDefinition` is a concept that mixes several different concerns. These concers can now be handeled and opted in individually with new matching annotations.

===== ApplicationStyles and LinkkiStyles

The classes containing the CSS class names that are used by *linkki* are renamed. `ApplicationStyles` from the core module is now called `LinkkiTheme`. `LinkkiStyles` from the application framework module is now called `LinkkiApplicationTheme`. In addition, the style name `LinkkiTheme.SPACING_HORIZONTAL_SECTION` is now deprecated and will not be set to a horizontal section in the Vaadin 8 version. The styles attached to this class name are no longer necessary in *linkki* with Vaadin 8. As the CSS class is no longer assigned by linkki, you need to adjust the selector in the SCSS file if you have used this class (`horizontal-section-spacing`) as a selector.

===== Removed Generic Type in PmoBasedTableFactory

The generic typ of `PmoBasedTableFactory` is removed. If you have previously created a new instance of `PmoBasedTableFactory` using the constructor, you need to remove the generic typ / diamond operator.

===== ButtonPmo and ButtonPmoBuilder

The interface `ButtonPmo` describes UI logic for buttons that are e.g. used in the section header. This interface has slightly changed as it used style names and buttons that have to be implemented differently in Vaadin 7 and Vaadin 8.

The existing static methods to create a new button with `ButtonPmo` are all moved to `ButtonPmoBuilder` in the `linkki-core-vaadin7` or `linkki-core-vaadin8` artifact respectively.

.Creation of buttons with ButtonPmo
[cols="a,a", options="header"]
|===
| Until now | New

| `ButtonPmo#newEditButton(Handler)` | `ButtonPmoBuilder#newEditButton(Handler)`
| `ButtonPmo#newDeleteButton(Handler)` | `ButtonPmoBuilder#newDeleteButton(Handler)`
|===
In addition to the abstract method `onClick`, the methods `getButtonIcon` and `getStyleNames` have also become abstract. +
If you have used this interface as a functional interface, consider using the `ButtonPmoBuilder.newEditButton` instead. If you implemented the interface in a class and have not implemented `getStyleNames` yet, you can use `ButtonPmoBuilder.DEFAULT_STYLES` to recreate the default. As for `getButtonIcon`, the default used to be set to `FontAwesome.PENCIL`.

Vaadin 8 uses `VaadinIcons` instead of `FontAwesome`.

==== Maven Archetypes for linkki
It is now even easier to set up a new *linkki* project with the archetypes for vanilla *linkki* projects and those using CDI or Spring Boot. See <<maven-archetypes, Maven Archetypes>>.

==== New Features in linkki for Vaadin 8

===== UI Components for Messages

A utility class `MessageUiComponents` has been introduced which creates different components to display `Message` and `MessageList`. Earlier `MessageListPanel` was used to show messages, to make the workflow simpler these classes had to be reworked. `MessagePmo` and `MessageRow` has been deprecated, instead `MessageRowPmo` has been created. `MessageTablePmo` has also been introduced to show messages in table. `MessageUiComponents` can be used to create `MessageTablePmo` like.

[source,java]
----
MessageUiComponents.createMessageTable("Title", () -> (messages), new BindingContext()));
----

.List of deprecated classes
[cols="a,a", options="header"]
|===
|Deprecated | New classes
|MessagePmo | MessageRowPmo
|MessageRow | MessageUiComponents#createMessageComponent
|MessageListPanel|MessageUiComponents#createMessageTable
|===

CSS style classes are available for `linkki-message-table`/`linkki-message-row` and `linkki-message-label`. In `linkki.scss` there were some styles (`linkki-message-panel`, `linkki-message-list`) defined that had never been set in the `MessageListPanel` but only in classes from other Faktor Zehn products like Faktor-IPM. Those have been removed from *linkki*. They are provided below for reference, but a switch to the new message components is recommended.

[source,css]
----
  .v-panel-content-linkki-message-list {
    max-height: 300px;
  }

  .v-splitpanel-vsplitter-linkki-message-panel-split {

    border: none;
    /* for separating lines between the messages:
    border-right: none;
    border-left: none;
    border-color: #ed473b !important;

  }

    @include background-image(linear-gradient(to bottom, $linkki-color-messagepanel 0%, $linkki-color-messagepanel 100%));
  }
----

===== Dynamic Style Name Binding

A new aspect <<bind-style-names,@BindStyleNames>> has been introduced, to set user defined styles. This will
overwrite any other user defined style names but not those from Vaadin. It is possible to provide multiple style names.

[source,java]
----
@BindStyleNames({"big", "blinking"})
public String getIcon() {
    return VaadinIcons.STAR.getHtml();
}
----

===== NonNull Annotations

In the pursuit of bug-free code we changed the annotations we use to mark whether methods accept and/or return null values from those of the Eclipse framework to those provided by SpotBugs. We recommend to disable annotation based null analysis in projects using *linkki* as Eclipse is not fully compatible with the SpotBugs annotations.

===== ValidationDisplayState

The `ValidationService` gained two new default methods:

 * `getValidationDisplayState()` to obtain a <<validation-display-state,`ValidationDisplayState`>>
 * `getFilteredMessages()` to filter the validation messages with the `ValidationDisplayState`

The `BindingManager` uses the filtered messages in `afterUpdateUi`.
