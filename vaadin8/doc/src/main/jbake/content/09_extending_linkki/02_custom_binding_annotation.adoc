=== Custom Annotation with `Binder`

`Binder` is used for manual binding of UI components that are annotated with the annotation <<manual-binding, @Bind>>. The annotation specifies certain properties that are commonly bound to UI components such as the value, as well as the visible/enabled/required states. In addition, it also defines how a bound property is identified with the help of the attributes `pmoProperty`, `modelObject` and `modelAttribute`.

If the annotation does not suit your needs then a custom annotation could be implemented easily. For example, it can be useful if you want to bind each property with an individual annotation.

The following example demonstrates how to design a custom `@BindValue` annotation to bind only the value of a component:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/java/org/linkki/samples/binding/annotation/BindValue.java[tags=custom-bind]
    ...
}
----

The custom annotation class must be annotated with another annotation called `@LinkkiBoundProperty` which provides a `BoundProperty`. A `BoundProperty` is necessary as it describes which property in the PMO and the business model should be bound to the annotated component. `@LinkkiBoundProperty` provides the `BoundProperty` by defining a creator Class that implements the interface `BoundPropertyCreator`. This creator must have a default constructor that can be later called by the *linkki* framework to create a `BoundProperty`.

In the example, the `@BindValue` annotation defines the `BindValueAnnotationBoundPropertyCreator` as its `@LinkkiBoundProperty`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/java/org/linkki/samples/binding/annotation/BindValue.java[tags=custom-bound-property-creator]
----

The example above works quite similar to the existing `@Bind` annotation. But it is also possible to define the bound property in a different way. For example, the model attribute and model object might be specified by another annotation.
If the model object is irrelevant, a simple `SimpleMemberNameBoundPropertyCreator` might be used which only uses the name of the annotated field or method.

Finally, the `@BindValue` annotation needs to define `BindFieldValueAspectDefinition` as a `@LinkkiAspect` (see <<creating-aspects, Aspects>>).

Now the `@BindValue` annotation can be used with a `Binder` for  <<manual-binding, manual binding>>:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/java/org/linkki/samples/binding/components/AddressFields.java[tags=addressFields-custom-bind]
----

Just as the `@Bind` annotation, the new annotation can also be used on getter methods:
