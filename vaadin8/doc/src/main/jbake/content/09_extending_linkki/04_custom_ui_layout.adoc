=== User-created layout annotation type

*linkki* offers some <<layout,standard layout annotations>> which are sufficient for the majority of use cases. Sometimes, a UI requires a particular layout. For this purpose one can either <<manual-section-creation,work with Vaadin layouts directly>> or create a new layout annotation type that can be used like `@UISection`.

This chapter shows the steps of creating the custom annotation type `@UIHorizontalLayout`, which differs from a `@UISection` with <<horizontal-section-layout,Horizontal Layout>> because it does not contain a section header and positions the labels above the fields.

NOTE: @UIHorizontalLayout is also included as standard annotation. This example is a slightly simplified version of the standard annotation.

The `@UIHorizontalLayout` annotation can be used to annotate a PMO as shown in the following listing:

==== Annotation Type

The next listing shows the annotation type for the horizontal layout. The relevant concepts are discussed below.

<1> Just like any other Java annotation type `@UIHorizontalLayout` has to specify `@Retention` and `@Target`. More detailed information about annotation types can be found at the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/predefined.html[Oracle Docs].
<2> The `@LinkkiComponent` meta-annotation specifies which <<layout-component-definition, ComponentDefinitionCreator>> class is used for `@UIHorizontalLayout`. Its purpose is to define how the actual UI layout is created.
<3> The `@LinkkiLayout` meta-annotation specifies which <<layout-definition, LayoutDefinitionCreator>> to use. A `LayoutDefinitionCreator` creates a `LayoutDefinition` that defines how UI elements are added to the layout.
<4> Finally, the `@LinkkiBoundProperty` meta-annotation specifies which <<layout-bound-property, PropertyCreator>> to use.

TIP: The custom layout annotation uses the same `Creator` / `Definition` pattern that is used for <<custom-ui-element-annotation, custom UI elements>>.

==== Component Definition

The next listing shows the `HorizontalComponentDefinitonCreator` that returns the `LinkkiComponentDefinition` using a lambda expression.

The purpose of the `LinkkiComponentDefinition` is to define how the actual Vaadin `HorizontalLayout` object is created. In this case it just needs to return a new `HorizontalLayout` instance. Due to the simplicity in this case a lambda expression is used to implement the `LinkkiComponentDefinition`. Since the `HorizontalComponentDefinitonCreator` gets a reference to the `UIHorizontalLayout` annotation, it can access its annotation type elements and use the values within the `LinkkiComponentDefiniton`. Using this mechanism it is possible to influence the layout at the creation time through annotation type elements.

[#layout-definition]
==== Layout Definition

The `HorizontalLayoutDefinitionCreator` that returns the `LinkkiLayoutDefinition` is implemented by a lambda expression and is shown in the next listing:

include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/java/org/linkki/samples/customlayout/annotation/UIHorizontalLayout.java[tags=layout-definition]
----
A `LinkkiLayoutDefinition` defines how child components are added to the `Layout`, while the `LayoutDefinitionCreator` creates the `LinkkiLayoutDefinition`, as the name suggests. As `LinkkiLayoutDefinition` is a `FunctionalInterface` it can be created using a lambda expression, as done in the `HorizontalLayoutDefinitionCreator`. If necessary, the `HorizontalLayoutDefinitionCreator` can pass information from the `UIHorizontalLayout` annotation to the `LinkkiLayoutDefintion`.

Within the `HorizontalLayoutDefinitionCreator#createChildren()` method the child UI elements are created and afterwards added to the `HorizontalLayout`. Fortunately it is possible to reuse standard *linkki* functionality for this purpose. The `UiCreator` is utilized to create a `Stream` of UI components from the PMO, while the `CaptionComponentWrapper` takes the `Label` of each UI component and adds it to the component as caption. After receiving the stream of components from the `UiCreator` the components can simply be added to the `HorizontalLayout`.

[#layout-bound-property]
==== Bound Property

The scope of the layout annotation is the PMO as a whole. Per convention the `BoundProperty` of a PMO itself is empty. Unlike a `BoundProperty` of a PMO element, as discussed <<03_custom_ui_element#bound-property, here>>, a `BoundProperty` of a PMO does not have a model object or attribute. As a result of these characteristics the `EmptyPropertyCreator` that creates an empty `BoundProperty` can be used for the `UIHorizontalLayout` annotation and other layout annotations.

The convention that the `BoundProperty` of a PMO is empty comes into play as well when the `@BindTooltip(tooltipType = TooltipType.DYNAMIC)` annotation is used: If a `BoundProperty` is annotated with `@BindTooltip(tooltipType = TooltipType.DYNAMIC)` *linkki* searches for the method `get<bound-property-name>Tooltip()` to retrieve the content for the tooltip. Since the name of the `BoundProperty` is empty per convention for the whole PMO, *linkki* will search for the method `getTooltip()` if the PMO is annotated with `@BindTooltip(tooltipType = TooltipType.DYNAMIC)`.

=== Using the PMO

The next listing shows how a PMO that is annotated with the `UIHorizontalLayout` annotation can be added to a Page:

[source, java]

include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/java/org/linkki/samples/customlayout/CustomLayoutUI.java[tags=CustomLayoutAnnotation]

`UiCreator#createComponent` creates Vaadin components from PMO objects and binds them to the passed `BindingContext`.
