=== SCSS

The module linkki application framework includes some convenient standard components that need to be styled with SCSS. These stylings are delivered by the style sheet `linkki.scss`. To make sure the linkki theme is applied correctly, import `linkki.scss` before the the valo theme in your SCSS. The linkki mixin should then be included after valo.

[source,css]
----
@import "linkki.scss";
@import "../valo/valo.scss";

.sample {
  @include valo;
  @include linkki;
}
