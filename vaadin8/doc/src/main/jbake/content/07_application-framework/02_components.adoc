=== UI

To create a Vaadin application you need to subclass `UI`. Using the *linkki application framework* you get a default implementation called `LinkkiUi` which handles the UI setup. The actual UI implementation is configured in your servlet using `@VaadinServletConfiguration`. To provide some views you could simply subclass `LinkkiUi` and use the `addView(...)` method or `addProvider(ViewProvider)`(for example with Vaadin's `CDIViewProvider`) as you need. The `LinkkiUi` uses the `ApplicationConfig` to configure various aspects.

You can see an example in the following `SampleApplicationUI`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-application}/org/linkki/samples/appsample/ui/SampleApplicationUI.java[tags=application-sample-ui]
----

The `LinkkiUi` offers methods that can be overridden to configure some Vaadin features, such as `configureNavigator` and `configureErrorHandler`.

==== Configuring the Navigator

To configure the navigator, override `LinkkiUi#configureNavigator(ViewDisplay)`, e.g.

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected void configureNavigator(ViewDisplay applicationLayout) {
  setNavigator(new MyNavigator(this, applicationLayout));
}
----

.Using CDI
[source,java]
----
@Inject
private CDINavigator cdiNavigator;

@Override
protected void configureNavigator(ViewDisplay applicationLayout) {
  cdiNavigator.init(this, applicationLayout);
  setNavigator(cdiNavigator);
}
----

.Using Spring
[source,java]
----
private final SpringNavigator springNavigator;

@Autowired
public MyUI(SpringNavigator springNavigator) {
  super(new MyApplicationConfig());
  this.springNavigator = springNavigator;
}

@Override
protected void configureNavigator(ViewDisplay applicationLayout) {
  springNavigator.init(this, applicationLayout);
  // no need to set the navigator as that is done by Vaadin-Spring
}
----

=== Application Configuration

The main aspects of the application are configured using the `ApplicationConfig`. This interface needs to be
implemented once in every *linkki* application and provided to the `LinkkiUi`. Next to some constants like name and version it configures the following parts:

  * The application layout which is the main UI component and contains the current view
  * Possible converters to convert values between UI and underlying model


=== Components

The *linkki* application framework contains the following components:

==== Application Layout

The application framework includes an `ApplicationLayout` that surrounds the main view with an `ApplicationHeader` and an optional `ApplicationFooter`.

The header is designed to have multiple menu actions on the left and may have some specific items like help menu or preferences on the right side.

The footer is hidden by default and can simply contain some application info or be extended to fit your needs.

Between `ApplicationHeader` and `ApplicationFooter` is the main area that displays your current `View`.

The `ApplicationLayout` is created using  the `ApplicationConfig`'s `createApplicationLayout()` method, which by default includes an `ApplicationHeader`(created using `getHeaderDefinition()`) with an `ApplicationMenu` containing all items provided by `getMenuItemDefinitions()`. The per default hidden `ApplicationFooter` can be created using `getFooterDefinition()`.


[[sidebarlayout]]
==== Sidebar Layout

The `SidebarLayout` is a UI component that gives access to several different views.

image::{image-dir}/sidebar-layout.png[]

On the left there is a vertical bar containing icons (buttons) for every sheet. The tooltip of the button displays the name of the corresponding sheet. The content of the selected sheet is displayed to the right of the bar.

In order to create a sidebar instantiate the `SidebarLayout` and add `SidebarSheets`. Every sheet requires an icon, a name and a content. It is also possible to provide a `Supplier<Component>` that is called when the sheet is selected for the first time (lazy initialization). This approach is useful if the creation of the content is more complex and/or if the sheet might be rarely visible.

Additionally you can supply a `UiUpdateObserver` that is triggered every time the sheet is selected, that means it gets visible. Use this observer to update your binding context in case of changes to the underlying model while the sheet was not selected. Our sample application contains a sidebar layout with two sheets that highlights the utility of that approach. The second sheet displays a list of reports which are created on the first sheet. Thus the second sheet needs to be updated every time it is selected because the underlying data might have changed in the meantime.

==== Headline

For every sheet it is useful to have a headline that describes the current content. It natively has a headline caption and could be extended by subclasses.

To use a `Headline` simply instantiate and add the component to your content.

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-application}/org/linkki/samples/appsample/view/MainView.java[tags=addHeadline-call]
----

If you want the Headline's title to be updated dynamically, you can also bind it to a PMO. To do so, create a PMO containing a corresponding getter method for `Headline#HEADER_TITLE`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-application}/org/linkki/samples/appsample/pmo/HeadlinePmo.java[tags=HeadlinePmo]
----

Then bind it with the headline:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-application}/org/linkki/samples/appsample/view/ReportListPage.java[tags=bind-headline]
