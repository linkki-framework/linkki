=== Displaying Validation Messages

By default *linkki* marks UI elements bound to invalid <<object-properties, ObjectProperties>>. The input field bound to the referenced `ObjectProperty` shows a colored border and background as well as a tooltip displaying the validation messages for that field. 

However, *linkki* does not provide a UI element to display all validation messages returned by a `ValidationService`. In order to display these messages a custom UI component has to be created along with a `BindingManager`. The `BindingManager` must override its `updateMessages` method that gets called after validation. A common pattern here is to use a `Consumer<MessageList>` as an argument to the `BindingManager` to decouple it from the actual custom UI component (which implements `Consumer<MessageList>`).
