=== Validating *linkki* Annotations

Unfortunately the **linkki-apt** cannot fully validate annotations that are part of the same module, since those annotations still have to be compiled. Yet, most of the validations still can be done.

.Validations that will always work:
* ensuring that methods being used by *linkki* are public
* ensuring that positions of components are unique inside a PMO
* ensuring that annotations of dynamic fields have the same position and are accompanied by a `get<PropertyName>ComponentType` method
* ensuring that specified model bindings actually exist
	- ensure model object does exist in the PMO
	- ensure model attribute does exist in the model object
* ensuring that bindings are explicitly specified
* ensuring that the name of a model object is unique

.Validations that only work on already compiled annotations:
* ensuring that `AvailableValuesType.ENUM_INCL_NULL` or `AvailableValuesType.ENUM_VALUES_EXCL_NULL` are only used with Enums and booleans (relies on `AvailableValuesAspectDefinition`)
* ensuring that methods required at runtime are defined (relies on the user defined `LinkkiAspectDefinition`)
	- (there is a distinction between abstract classes and interfaces and non-abstract classes)
	
Aspect related validations only work for `LinkkiAspectDefinitions` that are either a subclass of ModelToUiAspectDefinition or a `CompositeAspectDefinition` that consists only of `ModelToUiAspectDefinitions`. Any `LinkkiAspectDefinition` that is not a `ModelToUiAspectDefinition` will simply be excluded from validations. (For example `BindReadOnly` will be ignored, but `BindToolTip` will be validated.)

==== Custom Annotations

IMPORTANT: *linkki-apt* needs to be made aware of custom annotations created in your projects to offer validation for them.

In order to validate annotations that are not part of *linkki*, the classpath containing those annotations needs to be passed to the compiler as an annotation processor parameter like this:

[source]
----
-Aclasspath=<CLASSPATH>
----

This is required since the annotation processor needs to create an instance of the annotation, in order to validate its `LinkkiAspects`.

===== Using Maven

With Maven, you can pass the build classpath to the annotation processor with the help of the `maven-dependency-plugin`:
