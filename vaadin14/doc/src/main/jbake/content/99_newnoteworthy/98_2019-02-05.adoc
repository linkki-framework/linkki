==== `cancelHandler` in `OkCancelDialog`

We added a `cancelHandler` to `OkCancelDialog` which will be called when the cancel button is invoked. To create a new `OkCancelDialog` with a `cancelHandler`, the new extended constructor can be used. Alternatively, `PmoBasedDialogFactory` has also been extended by a new `newOkCancelDialog` method that accepts a `cancelHandler` in addition to the `okHandler`.

As the new functionality further increases the number of arguments that can be passed to `OkCancelDialog`, a `Builder` is introduced to simplify the creation of a dialog. `OkCancelDialog` provides a new static method `builder(String)` that creates a new builder:

[source,java]
----
OkCancelDialog.builder(caption)
              .okHandler(okHandler)
              .cancelHandler(cancelHandler)
              .build();
----

The builder also supports multiple content components to be consistent with the `newOkCancelDialog` method in `PmoBasedDialogFactory`. As the `OkCancelDialog` should now be created using the builder, the existing constructors using a nullable content component are deprecated. A new constructor taking all configurations is provided for overriding.

==== New creation mechanism of aspects

The creation of <<creating-aspects,linkki aspects>> has changed. Instead of giving the `LinkkiAspectDefinition` implementation class as the value for `@LinkkiAspect` annotation, an `AspectDefinitionCreator` implementation has to be used now.

This offers the benefit that the `LinkkiAspectDefinitions` do no longer need to depend on the corresponding annotations. The values from the annotations can be passed by the `AspectDefinitionCreator`. This makes the aspect definitions better testable and allows the use of the same aspect definition with multiple different annotations. The `initialize()` method of the `LinkkiAspectDefinition`, that up to now was called after creation via default constructor, is removed. The values previously read from the annotation in that method should now be read in the `AspectDefinitionCreator` and passed to the `LinkkiAspectDefinition` 's constructor, thus allowing instantiating aspect definitions from sources other than annotations.

===== API Changes

This feature brings several changes in the API:

* Existing `LinkkiAspectDefinitions` can no longer be used in `@LinkkiAspect` directly. It requires an implementation of `AspectDefinitionCreator` to create the aspect definitions. +
+
.Reading of the value in the `AspectDefinitionCreator`
[source,java]
----
class BindTooltipAspectDefintionCreator implements AspectDefinitionCreator<@NonNull BindTooltip> {

    @Override
    public LinkkiAspectDefinition create(BindTooltip annotation) {
        return new BindTooltipAspectDefinition(annotation.tooltipType(), annotation.value());
    }
}
----
* `initialize(Annotation)` is removed from the `LinkkiAspectDefinition` interface. All necessary information should be directly passed to the constructor instead. +
Previously, the `initialize` method had the responsibility of reading the relevant attributes from the given annotation. To make the aspect definition more flexible, we recommend moving this responsibility to the creator. The constructor of the aspect definition then directly take the relevant values.
+
.Previous instantiation of the aspect definition with annotation
[source,java]
----
@SuppressWarnings("null")
private TooltipType type;

@Override
public void initialize(Annotation annotation) {
    this.type = ((BindTooltip)annotation).type();
}
----
+
.New instantiation of the aspect definition with value
[source,java]
----
private final TooltipType type;

public BindTooltipAspectDefinition(TooltipType type) {
    this.type = type;
    this.value = value;
}
----
* If the existing `LinkkiAspectDefinition` extends `CompositeAspectDefinition`, the definition itself may not be needed any more. Instead, it can be turned into an aspect definition creator that creates a `CompositeAspectDefinition` in the `create(Annotation)` method.
+
.Creation of a `CompositeAspectDefinition`
[source,java]
----
public class MyAspectDefinitionCreator implements AspectDefinitionCreator<@NonNull MyAnnotation> {

@Override
public LinkkiAspectDefinition create(MyAnnotation annotation) {
return new CompositeAspectDefinition(
        new LabelAspectDefinition(annotation.label()),
        new VisibleAspectDefinition(annotation.visible()),
        new FieldValueAspectDefinition(),
        new ReadOnlyAspectDefinition());
    }
}
----

* `FieldAspectDefinition` has been a composite aspect definition for annotations that are annotated with `@LinkkiBindingDefinition`. This class is now removed as it is directly created as a composite aspect definition in `FieldAspectDefinitionCreator`. If you want to reuse this aspect definition, you can use the creator directly with `@LinkkiAspect(FieldAspectDefinitionCreator.class)` in your annotation class. Other aspects that are specific to you annotation can then be added in a separate `@LinkkiAspect` annotation.

==== Binding of aspects in `ContainerPmo`

The items, page length, and footer of a table are now bound to the `ContainerPmo` 's existing methods `getItems()`, `getPageLength()`, and `getFooterPmo()` using aspects. Consequently, `getFooterPmo()` is now bound fully dynamically. This fixes the previous bug that the footer is not removed dynamically once created.

==== Binding of labels as an aspect

The label is now bound using the aspect `LabelAspectDefinition`. If you have created a custom annotation that does *not* use the common `FieldAspectDefinition` you might need to add the new `LabelAspectDefinition` to your annotation.

==== `label` now mandatory in UI annotations

Our experience in multiple projects has shown that the label is specified directly with the field annotation in almost all cases. Even if the label is translated in `linkki-messages.properties`, it is useful to declare the `label` in the field annotation for documentation purposes. Therefore, the `label` property is now mandatory in all UI annotations except `@UIButton` and `@UICheckBox`.

Until now, there is a rarely known fallback value for the `label` attribute which is the capitalized property name. Thus, there was a special property `noLabel` to disable the label.

With this version the fallback to the property name is removed. Therefore the `noLabel` property is removed, too. If you do not want to show label, then simply use an empty String.

In `@UIButton` and `@UICheckBox` there was a property `showLabel` instead of `noLabel` because showing no label is the default for buttons and check boxes. Instead, both fields have a caption which is shown on top of the button or to the right of the check box. The property `showLabel` is removed, the default for `label` is still the empty String.

==== Default methods from interfaces in PMO classes

*linkki* now finds annotated methods that are inherited from interface default methods.

==== Custom @Bind-like annotation using `Binder` and fallback for `pmoProperty` in `@Bind`

The Annotation `@Bind` was refactored to allow creating other variations (see <<custom-binding-annotation, Custom Binding Annotation>>).

During this refactoring, a fallback mechanism to determine the `pmoProperty` attribute from the name of the annotated method (or field) has been implemented as well.

==== Deprecated classes

  * The methods `sizedLabel(AbstractOrderedLayout, String)` and `sizedLabel(Layout, String, ContentMode)` in the `ComponentFactory` have been marked as deprecated, as they duplicate the `newLabelWidthUndefined` methods with the same parameters which better fit the naming of the other methods in the class.
  * The classes `PmoBasedTableSectionFactory` and `SectionCreationContext` have been deprecated in favor of a unified class `PmoBasedSectionFactory`. You could use `PmoBasedSectionFactory.createSection(Object, BindingContext)` method to create all kinds of sections annotated with `@UISection`. If the PMO class implements
  `ContainerPmo` it automatically creates a `TableSection`.
  * The method `BindingContext.createDispatcherChain(Object, BindingDescriptor)` is deprecated. If you had overwritten this method, pass your `PropertyDispatcherFactory` to the new constructor `BindingContext(String, PropertyBehaviorProvider, Handler, PropertyDispatcherFactory)`.
  * The signatures of the methods in `PropertyDispatcherFactory` have changed. Instead of the `BindingDescriptor` it directly takes the newly introduced `BoundProperty` which holds the reference to the bound PMO property name as well as the model object name and model object property name.
