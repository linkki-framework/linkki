[[validation-service]]
=== ValidationService
A `ValidationService` is a simple functional interface that creates a <<message, MessageList>> containing validation result messages. In order to make use of a `ValidationService` in a `BindingManager`, it must be passed as an argument to the <<binding-basics,BindingManager>>'s constructor. As described in <<binding-basics,Binding, BindingContext, BindingManager>> it is part of the `BindingManager` and not of a `BindingContext` because validation violations may refer to other input fields that are not part of the current `BindingContext`.

As mentioned in <<domain-model-binding,Binding to the Domain Model>> a *linkki* application consists of multiple layers.

Most validations work on the domain model because the goal of the validation is to validate the data of the domain model itself. Other components, like services or batch processes can then also make use of those validations.

In most applications the validation service simply calls the domain model validation and collects all messages. In order to avoid a dependency from the domain model to *linkki* it is good practice to use an own implementation for messages in the domain model. In this case the validation service is also responsible for converting from domain layer messages to a *linkki* `MessageList`. 

[[validation-display-state]]
==== ValidationDisplayState

When a user enters a page containing required fields, it is usually not desirable to greet him with a lot of validation error messages without a chance to enter the values first. *linkki* supports a more pleasant experience with the `ValidationDisplayState`: `HIDE_MANDATORY_FIELD_VALIDATIONS` filters all messages with a <<validation-marker,ValidationMarker>> returning `true` for `isRequiredInformationMissing()` while `SHOW_ALL` does not filter messages.

The `ValidationService` can return a `ValidationDisplayState` via `getValidationDisplayState()` and offers the method `getFilteredMessages()` that takes the messages from `getValidationMessages()` and applies the `ValidationDisplayState`'s `filter` method. It is good practice to switch the `ValidationDisplayState` once the user has triggered a submit button or another page advancement mechanism.

[[message]]
==== Message and MessageList
A `Message` has a human readable text, an error code and a `Severity` (one of `INFORMATION`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`). It may also contain a set of <<object-properties,ObjectProperties>> to refer to specific invalid properties of an object. Additionally there may be <<validation-marker,ValidationMarkers>> to distinguish different kinds of validation messages.

The easiest way to create a `Message` is to use its builder (via the `builder()` method). Alternatively, a `Message` can also be created using the static factory methods (`createError()`, `createWarning()`, `createInfo()`) or by directly calling the constructor.

A `MessageList` is a container for a list of messages and provides an API to access the messages, for example by using filters.

[[object-properties]]
==== ObjectProperties
A *linkki* message uses a set of `ObjectProperty` to identify which properties and objects the message refers to. An `ObjectProperty` consists of a reference to the bound object as well as the property's name. If the property has an indexed type, the `ObjectProperty` can additionally contain the index of the referred value in its collection.


[[validation-marker]]
==== ValidationMarker
`ValidationMarkers` are used to group and categorize messages. By default, *linkki* can differentiate between mandatory-field validations and other messages using the validation marker `ValidationMarker#REQUIRED`. UI elements referring to messages that use this marker are not highlighted as long as a user hasn't had a chance to enter any values (see <<validation-display-state, ValidationDisplayState>>). The method `isMandatoryFieldMessage` on a `Message` can be used to check if any of the message's markers return `true` for `isRequiredInformationMissing`:

Applications can introduce their own specialized validation markers by implementing the `ValidationMarker` interface. That way special meaning can be attached to messages and they can be categorized and processed accordingly, if required.
