== Creation of a UI with *linkki*

*linkki* offers three ways to create a UI:

1. <<pmo-create-layout, via a layout annotation on the PMO>>
2. <<ui-creator, with a `UiCreator` for more layout control>> 
3. <<manual-binding, manual binding via `@Bind`>>

The first approach is hopefully sufficient in almost all cases. It defines the *linkki* default way to create any layout element.

The second approach defines a way to create components and bindings from the content of a PMO without defining the layout. It may be useful in cases of very specific layouts that are rarely used.

The third approach leaves the creation of UI elements entirely to the developer and only uses linkki for data binding.
