[[linkki-apt]]
== linkki-apt

*linkki-apt* is an annotation processor for the Java compiler and is intended to support development with *linkki*.

The annotation processor makes development with *linkki* more comfortable as it provides compile time validation for possible runtime problems.
For example, *linkki* relies on naming conventions to find required methods at runtime, so it's very important to use the correct names, since otherwise the application will crash.

Some of the checks the annotation processor does:

* ensuring that methods being used by *linkki* are public
* ensuring that positions of components are unique inside a pmo
* ensuring that dynamic fields have the same position and are accompanied by a get<PropertyName>ComponentType method
* ensuring that specified model bindings actually exist
* and more
