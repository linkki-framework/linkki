/**
 * A container binding represents a {@link Binding} that is itself a {@link BindingContext}. That means
 * it acts as a {@link Binding} within another {@link BindingContext} but also handles other bindings
 * that are included in the corresponding UI container. It gives the ability to structure the bindings
 * in the same hierarchy as the UI is structured.
 * <p>
 * For example a table has bindings for the whole table like the items or the page length. These are
 * aspects that are managed within a {@link ContainerBinding}. The table on the other hand includes
 * multiple fields that are managed as bindings within this {@link ContainerBinding}.
 * <p>
 * The logic of the {@link ContainerBinding} ensures that the aspects of this binding are dealt with
 * before any child {@link Binding} is triggered.
