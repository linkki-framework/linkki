/**
 * Meta-annotation indicating that an annotation type (that is also annotated with
 * {@link LinkkiAspect}) is automatically inherited from superclasses and interfaces.
 * <p>
 * When scanning a class' superclasses and interfaces for aspects, only annotations on which
 * {@link InheritedAspect @InheritedAspect} is present are taken into account.
 * <p>
 * This differs from the {@link Inherited @Inherited} meta-annotation that only leads to annotations
 * being inherited from superclasses.
 * <p>
 * Note that this meta-annotation has no effect outside of linkki's {@link AspectAnnotationReader}.
