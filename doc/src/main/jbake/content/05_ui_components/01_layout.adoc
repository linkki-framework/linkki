[[layout]]
=== Layouts

*linkki* provides some standard layout annotations which are described here. If you need another layout it is quite easy to <<custom-ui-layout-annotation,create custom layout annotations>>.

[[layout-section]]
==== Section

A group of input fields is called _section_. 

[[section-header]]
Section Header:: A section usually has a _section header_ that contains a descriptive **title** which summarizes the content of the input group. This titled is visually separated from the content by a **separating line** in the header. Without a section header, a section is not directly recognizable as such, but looks like a simple layout. +
A section may be **closable** with a button in the section header. When closed, its content is collapsed to give a better overview about the whole page.

Content:: The input fields of a section is typically ordered as a form, field description being on the left of the input elements. Instead of input fields, the content of a section can also be a table. If a section contains a table instead of multiple input fields it is called _TableSection_.

*linkki* offers two annotations to create a section:

* `@UISection`
* `@UIFormSection`

Both annotations share the attribute to controll the content of the <<section-header, section header>>:

* `caption`: short description of the section
* `closable`: whether the section can be collapsed

===== Differences between `@UISection` and `@UIFormSection`

* A `@UISection` uses a `GridLayout` while `@UIFormSection` uses a `FormLayout`, making it easier to customize with CSS.
* `@UISection` can be used to create a `TableSection` if the PMO class is a  <<ui-container-pmo, Container PMO>>. `@UIFormSection` does not have this functionality.
* `@UISection` has <<layout-uisection, multiple layout options>> including a multi column layout, `@UIFormSection` only offers single column. 
* `@UIFormSections` can have a fixed label width to align multiple sections. Label width in `@UISection` is determined by the longest label in each section.

[[formsection-label-width]]
===== Label width in @UIFormSection

By default, the labels in a section take up as much space as the longest label in the section. When display multiple sections below each other, that often has the undesired effect that each section has a different label width. 

To mitigate this issue, `LinkkiTheme` offers two style names that can be applied to the surrounding layout such as `AbstractPage`:

* `LABEL_FIXED_WIDTH`: All `@UIFormSections` in the layout have a fixed label width, by default `9em`.
* `LABEL_FIXED_WIDTH_LONG`: All `@UIFormSections` in the layout have a long fixed label width, by default `12em`.

Customization:: Both widths can be customized globally in the SCSS theme. The width of `LABEL_FIXED_WIDTH` can be customized by defining the variable value `$linkki-label-fixed-width` in the SCSS. The width of `LABEL_FIXED_WIDTH_LONG` is defined by the variable `$linkki-caption-fixed-width-long`. Note that it is important to defined the variable value **before** importing `linkki.scss`.

Line Break in Labels:: With a fixed label width, labels that exceed the defined width are broken into multiple lines. The line breaks at white spaces whenever possible. If your label does not have any white spaces, this may cause a line break at an unexpected place, which may impair readability.

[[layout-uisection]]
===== Layout Options in @UISection

[source, java]

----

The layout for all the components within a `UISection` can be defined with the attribute `layout`. *linkki* defines the possible layouts in the enum `SectionLayout`: HORIZONTAL, COLUMN or CUSTOM.
.

[[horizontal-section-layout]]
Horizontal Section Layout:: With the horizontal layout all input fields are displayed on a line, side by side in the order of their position. The attribute `columns` is ignored.

[[column-section-layout]]
Column Section Layout:: With the column layout fields are displayed one below the other. If additionally a number of columns are defined with the property `columns`, a kind of grid layout is produced. The grid is filled in the order of the field's position from left to right, row by row. 

[[custom-section-layout]]
Custom Section Layout:: Custom layout does not directly define the layout but gives the ability to create a HTML file containing the exact position of each control. Therefore it uses the https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/layout/layout-customlayout.html[CustomLayout] from Vaadin.
+
All you have to do is to create a HTML file located in the `layouts` folder in your theme folder. The HTML file has to be named with the simple name of your PMO and use the file extension `.html`. Within this HTML file you use `<div location="...">` elements as placeholder for every component. Within the `location` attribute you use the PMO property name to reference the component as needed. If you also want to have the placeholder for the PMO defined label you simply use the PMO property name with the suffix `-label`. In the PMO there are no restrictions. The position will be ignored, as it is determined by the HTML template.
+
As an example, custom layout can be used to create a address input section where the fields "Street" and "Number" are shown in the same line with a predefined width, as well as the fields "Zip" and "City".

[[section-label-alignment]]
===== Label alignment in sections

By default, the labels are right aligned in a section. A right alignment has the advantage that the label and the corresponding input control are always visually close. In case the length of the labels vary strongly in a section, left alignment can make a label appear far away from the input control itself. This can make the form look less ordered as the affiliation between the label and the input control is broken visually.

To change this behavior, declare `$linkki-label-alignment: left` before importing `linkki.scss`.

[[section-header-annotation]]
===== Adding UI Elements to the Section Header

To add more elements, for example an edit button, to the section's header than just the caption, you can annotate regular <<ui-element, UI elements>> in the section's PMO with the `@SectionHeader` annotation. They will then be placed in the header instead of in the section's content area.

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir-playground}/org/linkki/samples/playground/dynamicannotations/DynamicCaptionWithSectionHeaderButtonPmo.java[tags=section-header]
----

TIP: The position is validated by linkki to be unique in the PMO independent of where the element will be placed in a section, so it is recommended to use negative numbers for the elements marked with `@SectionHeader` to avoid conflicts with the regular elements.

TIP: The same effect could previously be achieved by implementing the interface `PresentationModelObject` with the method `getEditButtonPmo()` where the returned `ButtonPmo` defines the button and its behavior. As this allows only limited control over the button and no other elements, using a `@SectionHeader` annotated `@UiButton` like shown above is to be preferred.

==== Simple Vaadin Layouts

Beside the section there are some simple Vaadin layouts that can be created with the corresponding annotations:

 * `@UIHorizontalLayout`
 * `@UIVerticalLayout`
 * `@UIFormLayout`
 * `@UICssLayout`

Some of these annotations may have special parameters to configure the alignment of the contained components.

TIP: To create the UI from a PMO with these layouts you should use `VaadinUiCreator`. The `PmoBasedSectionFactory` is only usable for `@UISection` whereas the `VaadinUiCreator` could be used for all kinds of layouts.


[[section-id]]
==== SectionID

Each HTML element of a layout may define an ID. This can be used, for instance, to identify a section for UI testing. By default the simple name of the class is used as the ID. Alternatively the annotation '@SectionID' can be used to specify a method that returns the ID for the section.

A method annotated with '@SectionID' is called by *linkki* when the section is created. The ID remains the same for the duration of the session and is not updated dynamically.

To access the section ID, the helper method `Sections.getSectionId(Object)` may be used.

NOTE: Although the concept is named _SectionID_ it is also applied to all kinds of layouts.
