=== Error Styles
*linkki* calls `setComponentError` on all fields bound to properties for which a message exists. Vaadin then sets different CSS style classes depending on the `ErrorLevel` of the <<message, message>>. For example, a text field with a `WARNING` will have the style `v-textfield-error-warning` while a text field with an `ERROR` will have the style class `v-textfield-error-error`. These `ErrorLevel` specific classes are set in addition to a more general one just ending in `-error` such as like `v-textfield-error`.
