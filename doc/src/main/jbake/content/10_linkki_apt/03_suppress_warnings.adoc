=== SuppressWarnings

*linkki-apt* creates warnings when a bad style is being used, for example using implicit model binding where a model attribute name is not given in the annotation but derived from the annotated method's name. 
It is possible to suppress those warnings by annotating the affected method with the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation and passing the value "linkki" or "all" (which would also ignore other warnings by the Java compiler) to it.
