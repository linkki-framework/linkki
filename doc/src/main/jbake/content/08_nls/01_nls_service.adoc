=== Location of resource bundles

The translations used by the PMO NLS service must be located in the project's resource folder, mirroring the path of the used pmo. For example:

.An example of a nls folder structure
image::{image-dir}/nlsFolderStructure.png[]

In this example, NLS Strings in org.linkki.samples.binding.pmo.ButtonsSectionPmo that need to be translated must be defined in org.linkki.samples.binding.pmo.linkki-messages.properties.

These `.properties` files contain messages in text form, each file represents one supported language for the PMOs in the same folder. It's important that these files share the base name `linkki-messages`. A file with the base name has to be present in the resource folder and acts as fall back option if no specific `.properties` file is found for a locale. You can support as many languages as you want by simple adding another `.properties` file to the resource folder, its name consisting of the base name and the language code separated by `_`. As shown in the example above, the German translations are represented by the file `linkki-messages_de.properties`. Note that each of these files have to contain the same items, but translated for the language they represent.

=== Predefined key structure for linkki PMO

An entry for a PMO property in the `.properties` files consists of two parts: The "key" that identifies a localizable aspect of a PMO property and the text, seperated by `=`.
The key is a String that consists of the PMOs class name, the name of the PMO property name and the localizable aspect of the property, seperated by `_`. The `linkki-messages.properties` file from the picture above looks like this:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/resources/org/linkki/samples/binding/pmo/linkki-messages.properties[tags=properties]
----

The second entry of the above `.properties` file points to the PMO `ContactRowPmo`, and provides an English translation for the label of its property `name`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/java/org/linkki/samples/binding/pmo/ContactRowPmo.java[tags=contactRowPmo-labelBinding]
----

Note that linkki always tries to retrieve a value from the `linkki-messages.properties`, if the file exists. That means that the label "Name" that is defined directly in the annotation `UiLabel` above will not be used in this constellation. The entry `ContactRowPmo_name_label=name` overrides it as default value if there is no specific `.properties` file for the users locale.

=== Translatable PMO properties

All aspects containing String values can be translated. Frequently used examples are label, caption and toolip. Section captions can also be translated. Its key does not contain a property name but only the PMOs class name and "_caption". For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/java/org/linkki/samples/binding/pmo/ChildrenSectionPmo.java[tags=sectionCaption]
----

With its German translation entry in `linkki-messages_de.properties`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir-binding-sample}/resources/org/linkki/samples/binding/pmo/linkki-messages_de.properties[tags=sectionCaption]
----
