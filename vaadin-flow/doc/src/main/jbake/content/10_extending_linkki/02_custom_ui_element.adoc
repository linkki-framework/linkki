=== Custom UI element annotation

It is possible to keep the clean structure of PMO code even if the application needs UI elements that are not part of *linkki*'s UI element set by creating custom annotations for UI elements. The following example shows how to create a custom annotation for a radio button group:

The self-defined `@UIRadioButtonGroup` annotation type can be used inside a PMO:

==== Annotation Type

The next listing shows the whole annotation type `UIRadioButtonGroup`. The relevant concepts and requirements are discussed below.

include::{source-dir}/java/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/annotation/UIRadioButtonGroup.java[tags=custom-annotation]
----

<1> Just like any other Java annotation type `@UIRadioButtonGroup` has to specify `@Retention` and `@Target`. More detailed information about annotation types can be found at the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/predefined.html[Oracle Docs]
<2> *linkki* must be able to position the custom UI element. Therefore the annotation type must be annotated with `@LinkkiPositioned` to indicate that it defines a position property. The actual `position()` annotation type element  is annotated with `@LinkkiPositioned.Position`.
<3> The annotation type elements `label()`, `content()`, `enabled()` and so on are <<aspect-definitions, LinkkiAspects>> that enable the user of the `@UIRadioButtonGroup` annotation to alter the appearance of the UI element by setting the corresponding parameter to the `@UIRadioButtonGroup` annotation. It is necessary to provide an `AspectDefinition` for each `Aspect` through an `AspectDefinitionCreator` class.
<4> The <<bound-property, BoundProperty>> is necessary for *linkki* to define the correlation between the UI element and the model side (PMO or model object) for binding purposes.
<5> The `@LinkkiComponent` meta-annotation specifies which <<component-definition, ComponentDefinitionCreator>> class is used. A `ComponentDefinitionCreator` is necessary to define how to create the actual UI element.

[#component-definition]
=== Component Definition

A `ComponentDefinition` defines how the actual UI element is created. In this case the `RadioButtonGroup` from the Vaadin framework is created.
The following listing shows the `UIRadioButtonGroupComponentDefinitionCreator` class and the corresponding `UIRadioButtonGroupComponentDefinition` class.

.Implementation of the UIRadioButtonGroupComponentDefinitionCreator
[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir}/java/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/annotation/UIRadioButtonGroup.java[tags=component-definition]
----
The `ComponentDefinition` for the `UIRadioButtonGroup` is not directly specified for the `UIRadioButtonGroup` by the `@LinkkiComponent` meta-annotation. Instead, the `UIRadioButtonGroupComponentDefinitionCreator` which holds a reference to the annotation type and creates the actual `UIRadioButtonGroupDefinition` is specified. This separation makes `ComponentDefinition` also usable without annotations and reusable for other annotations.

TIP: The separation of DefinitionCreators that are annotated to the annotation type and Definitions without annotation type dependencies is used for `BoundProperties` and `AspectDefinitions` as well. All `Creator` classes contain a `create()` method, that will return the relevant `Definition`.

In the example the `UIRadioButtonGroupComponentDefinitionCreator` holds a reference to the actual `UIRadioButtonGroup` annotation type and passes the required arguments to create the actual Vaadin UI element to the constructor of `UIRadioButtonGroupDefinition`. In this specific case the aspects `width` and `ItemCaptionProvider` are needed at the time of creation. The `UIRadioButtonGroupComponentDefinition#createComponent(Object pmo)` method is called by *linkki* itself.

[#bound-property]
=== Bound Property

The property on the model side (PMO / model object) that is considered for data binding is called `BoundProperty`. In our example the property "gender" inside the PMO that is annotated with `@UIRadioButtonGroup` is the `BoundProperty` for this specific `RadioButtonGroup`. Most notably, `BoundProperty` is used to determine how an <<aspects, aspect value>> is retrieved. For example, the `enabled` aspect of the `@UIRadioButtonGroup` will be retrieved by the method `isGenderEnabled`, as the bound PMO property is named "gender".

NOTE: For UI annotation that are used on methods, a `BoundProperty` needs to have at least the property name of the PMO property. Optionally, it can contain the model object and attribute for model binding. +
Annotations on classes typically use an empty `BoundProperty`. That way, the aspect methods for the whole PMO do not contain any property name.

The annotation `LinkkiBoundProperty` points to a `BoundPropertyCreator` that defines how a `BoundProperty` should be created from the annotated annotation. The `UIRadioButtonGroup` uses the existing `ModelBindingBoundPropertyCreator` that derives the `BoundProperty` from the PMO property, and also determines the model object and model attribute from annotation attributes that are annotated with `@LinkkiBoundProperty.@ModelObject` and `@LinkkiBoundProperty.@ModelAttribute` respectively. This enables <<domain-model-binding, binding to the domain model>>.

[NOTE] 
====
Aside from `ModelBindingBoundPropertyCreator`, *linkki* also provides some other implementations: 

* `EmptyPropertyCreator` - Creates an empty `BoundProperty`
* `SimpleMemberNameBoundPropertyCreator` - Derives the `BoundProperty` from only the PMO property
====

[#aspect-definitions]
===  Aspect Definitions

`LinkkiAspects` are the aspects that *linkki* has to take into consideration for the binding between the `BoundProperty` and the actual UI element. In most cases a change of an `Aspect` on the model side has to result in a change on the UI element and vice versa, so that the state of the UI reflects the state of the model. An `AspectDefinition` defines the type of the `Aspect` and what needs to be done if the `Aspect` changes.

The `UIRadioButtonGroup` has the aspects `label`, `content`, `enabled`, `required` and `visible`. Every Aspect must be defined within an `AspectDefinition`.
This is done in the `UIRadioButtonGroup` using `AspectDefinitionCreators`:

. The `ValueAspectDefinitionCreator` is an existing `AspectDefinitionCreator` that is reused by the `UIRadioButtonGroup` to define the aspect value change.
. `UIRadioButtonGroupFieldAspectDefinitionCreator` defines all other Aspects using a `CompositeAspectDefinition`:

.Implementation of the UIRadioButtonGroupFieldAspectDefinitionCreator
[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir}/java/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/annotation/UIRadioButtonGroup.java[tags=aspect-definition]
----
The `UIRadioButtonGroupFieldAspectDefinitionCreator#create()` method gets a reference to the `UIRadioButtonGroup` annotation like other `*Creator#create()` methods as well. Given this reference it can access all annotation type elements that belong to the aspects and pass them to the appropriate `AspectDefinition`.

*linkki* contains many existing `AspectDefinitions` that can be reused, like the `EnabledAspectDefinition` in this example. Common `AspectDefinitions` are:

.Common LinkkiAspectDefinitions
|===
|`ValueAspectDefinition`| Aspect definition for components that implement `HasValue`.
|`LabelValueAspectDefinition`|The value aspect for a `LinkkiText`. As `LinkkiText` label is a read-only component, hence this aspect only reads the value from model and updates the UI.
|`CaptionAspectDefinition`|Aspect definition for the caption of a component that implements either `HasText`, `HasCaption` or is a `CheckBox`.
|`DerivedReadOnlyAspectDefinition` | Makes sure that a component that implements `HasValue` is read-only if the setter method is missing.
|`BindReadOnlyAspectDefinition`| Aspect definition for the read-only state of an input element that implements `HasValue`.
|`EnabledAspectDefinition`|Aspect definition for the enabled state of an input element.
|`AvailableValuesAspectDefinition`| Aspect definition for the available values of a selection component such as `ComboBox`. For components that implement `HasListDataView`, `GenericAvailableValuesAspectDefinition` can be used.
|`RequiredAspectDefinition`|Aspect definition that displays the required indicator of a input component that implements `HasValue`.
|`VisibleAspectDefinition`|Aspect definition for the visible state of a component.
