=== Step 1: Implementing the search bar

[NOTE]
This step introduces the concept of a *linkki PMO*. You will learn how to create a so-called *section* with such a PMO and the annotation `@UISection`. Along with that, you will also be introduced to the first component annotations `@UITextField` and `@UIButton`.

The linkki archetype already provides the fundamental setup for your `BusinessPartnerView`. In this step, you will create an input field in the view where the user can enter a search term and trigger the search.

==== Creating the section to enter search criteria

[NOTE]
In *linkki*, each layout element is represented by a <<databinding, *Presentation Model Object* (PMO)>> that is annotated with a <<layout, layout annotation>>. The most commonly used layout is the section (<<layout-section, `@UISection`>>).

To start with the first layout, create a class with the name `SearchSectionPmo` and annotate it with <<layout-section, `@UISection`>>.

To implement the text field for search term input, do the following:

. Create a new field `searchText` that stores the user's input.
. Create and implement the getter method for the property `searchText` with the signature `String getSearchText()`.
. Annotate the getter method with <<ui-textfield, `@UITextField`>>. The annotation requires a value `position` which can be set to an arbitrary positive integer value, e.g. 10.
. Create and implement the setter method for the property `searchText`. This method should have the signature `public void setSearchText(String)`.

The finished implementation looks like this:

.SearchSectionPmo.java
[source,java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/section/SearchSectionPmo.java[tags=searchfield]
----

[NOTE]
Just like layouts, input components are also represented by annotations. The <<ui-element, built-in annotations>> cover the components that are most commonly used in a form. It is also possible to create <<custom-ui-element-annotation, custom annotations>> for other UI components.

The UI element `UITextField` is declared via the annotation `@UITextField`. It is followed by two properties: `position` and `label`.

[NOTE]
The attribute <<position, `position`>> defines the display order of the components inside a layout.

[NOTE]
====
The getter method that is annotated with <<ui-element, UI element annotation>> determines what is displayed in the field. The setter method defines what happens with the user input. The mechanism of a PMO is further explained in <<databinding, the documentation>>.

In summary, whenever the user input changes, the `setSearchText` method will be called, including the actual user's input as argument. Subsequently, the text field will display the return value from the `getSearchText` method. 

The following image illustrates the data binding for the property `searchText`:

[[tutorial-search-button]]
To additionally display a button to trigger the search, do the following:

. Create a new field `searchConsumer` of type `Consumer<String>`.
. Create a constructor with the signature `SearchSectionPmo(Consumer<String>)` which assigns the argument to the field `searchConsumer`.
. Create a new method `search` with the signature `public void search()`
. Implement the method with `searchConsumer.accept(searchText)`
. Annotate the method with `@UIButton`. 
.. The `position` should be a higher number than the position of `@UITextField`, e.g. 20.
.. The `caption` should be set to "Start Search".

The finished implementation should look like this:

.SearchSectionPmo.java
[source,java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/section/SearchSectionPmo.java[tags=searchButton]
----
[NOTE]
As a button does not store any values, the annotation is not added to a getter method, but a void method. Whenever the user clicks on the button, the method `search()` is invoked. The corresponding PMO property is called `search`.

The search action itself is a functionality that should not be directly implemented in the PMO as it requires interaction with external systems. Thus it should be passed to the PMO as a constructor argument.

[TIP]
In your application, you will often use the _functional interfaces_ `org.linkki.util.handler.Handler` and `java.util.function.Consumer<T>` in order to separate a button's execution logic from its definition within the Presentation Model Object (PMO) classes. The `Handler` is a representation of a method *without arguments and without a return value*. The `Consumer<T>` represents a method *with a single input argument and without a return value*.

[[tutorial-search-page]]
==== Creating and showing `SearchSectionPmo` on a `Page`

Now that you have the search input section, do as follows to create and display the section represented by `SearchSectionPmo`:

. Create a Class `SearchPage` that extends `AbstractPage`.
. Create a field `bindingManager` of type <<binding-basics, BindingManager>> and initialize it with `new DefaultBindingManager()`.
. Implement the method `getBindingManager()` which returns the field `bindingManager`.
. Define a new method `public void search(String)` with no implementation yet.
. Implement the method createContent with `addSection(new SearchSectionPmo(this::search))`.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.SearchPage.java
[source,java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/page/SearchPage.java[tags=searchPageInit]

    public void search(String searchText) {
        // will be implemented later
    }
}
----

<1> `AbstractPage` is an implementation of `Page` by *linkki* in which sections can be conveniently created and added by providing the corresponding PMOs.

Next, implement the search functionality as follows:

. Create a new field `foundPartners` with the type `List<BusinessPartner>` to store the search results.
. Initialize the field `foundPartners` with `new ArrayList<>()`.
. Extend the constructor of `SearchPage` with an additional argument of type `org.linkki.samples.appsample.model.BusinessPartnerRepository`. This type is provided by the dependency `sample-model` and implements the search functionality.
. Store the constructor argument in a new field `partnerRepository`.
. Implement the method `search`: Execute the method `findBusinessPartner` from `partnerRepository` with the method argument and store the result in the field `foundPartners`.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.SearchPage.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/page/SearchPage.java[tags=search]
----

[[tutorial-search-page-init]]
==== Showing `SearchPage` in `BusinessPartnerView`

The `SearchPage` is still not displayed yet. To create and display the page, go to the class `BusinessPartnerView` and modify the constructor as follows:

. Extend the constructor with an argument of type `BusinessPartnerRepository`.
. Annotate the constructor with https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-autowired-annotation[`@Autowired`].
. Create a new `Headline` using the constructor and the argument `"Partner Search"`  and add it to the view with `add`.
. Create a new `SearchPage` using the constructor.
. Call the `init()` method of the created `SearchPage` to create the content of the page and add the created `SearchPage` to the view with `add`.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.BusinessPartnerView.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/view/BusinessPartnerView.java[tags=businessPartnerViewConstructor]
----

The method `AbstractPage.init()` takes care of creating the page _after_ the constructor has been called.

==== Viewing the result in the application

If you run your application now, you should be able to see the `SearchSectionPmo`. The view begins with the title "Partner Search" and is followed by a search bar and a search button called "Start Search".

.Search bar and button

For now, clicking the search button does not affect the UI. The <<tutorial-step-2, next step>> extends the UI to display the search result.
