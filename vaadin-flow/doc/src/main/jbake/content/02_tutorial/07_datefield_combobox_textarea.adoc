=== Step 5: UIDateField, UIComboBox & UITextArea

[NOTE]
This step introduces you to the UI elements `UIDateField`, `UIComboBox` and `UITextArea`.

Next, you will create and fill out a page to display general information of a business partner, such as the name and date of birth.

==== Implementing a new PMO

The page should contain a section to display partner details. Therefore, create a new class `PartnerDetailsSectionPmo` and annotate it with `@UISection`. Its caption should be set to "Partner Details".

`PartnerDetailsSectionPmo` should define UI Elements for the name and date of birth of the partner as well as their status and some notes. You need a `UITextField`, a <<ui-datefield, `UIDateField`>>, a <<ui-combobox, `UIComboBox`>> and a <<ui-textarea, `UITextArea`>>. Implement them as follows:

. Pass a `BusinessPartner` to the constructor and assign it to the field `partner`. 
. Create and implement the getter method for the property `name` and annotate it with `@UITextField`.
.. Get the name by calling the getter method on the partner.
.. The label should be set to "Name".
. Create and implement the setter method for the property `name`. Set the name by calling the setter method on the partner.
. Create and implement the getter method for the property `dateOfBirth` with the signature `LocalDate getDateOfBirth()` the same way as in 2i.
. Annotate the getter with <<ui-datefield, `@UIDateField`>>. The label should be set to `Date of Birth`.
. Create and implement the setter method for the property `dateOfBirth` the same way as in 3.
. Create and implement the getter method for the property `status` with the signature `Status getStatus()`.
. Annotate the getter with <<ui-combobox, `@UIComboBox`>>. The label should be set to "Status".
. Create and implement the setter method for the property `status`.
. Create and implement the getter method for the property `note` with the signature `String getNote()`.
. Annotate the getter with <<ui-textarea, `@UITextArea`>>. The label should be set to "Note".
. Create and implement the setter method for the property `note`.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.PartnerDetailsSectionPmo.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/section/PartnerDetailsSectionPmo.java[tags=partnerdetails]
----

==== Creating the basic data page

Now that the section is done, create a new `AbstractPage` called `BasicDataPage`, initialize it as you did in <<tutorial-search-page, step 1>> and add the `PartnerDetailsSectionPmo` in the `createContent` method.

[[tutorial-basic-data-page]]
=== Updating `PartnerDetailsView`

Since you have created the `BasicDataPage`, you need to update `PartnerDetailsView`. If you remember what was said in the <<tutorial-search-page-init,first step>> of this tutorial, you know you have to call `BasicDataPage.init()` after calling the constructor, otherwise the content of the page won't be created.

Therefore, update the method `createBasicDataPage` as follows:

. Create a new instance of `BasicDataPage`.
. Call the `init()` method.
. Return the created `BasicDataPage`.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.PartnerDetailsView.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/view/PartnerDetailsView.java[tags=createBasicDataPage]
----

You should now be able to see a `BasicDataPage` with the personal information of a partner. For John Doe, you should only be able to see their name and date of birth (27/08/1978).

The <<tutorial-step-6, next step>> extends the UI to display all addresses of a partner.
