=== Step 8: Adding a button to a header

[NOTE]
This step teaches you how to add a button to the header of a page. You will also learn how to show notifications using `NotificationUtil`.

Now that the user can delete addresses, you will add a button to create new ones.

==== Adding a button in `AddressTablePmo`

To have the button next to the caption "Addresses", do the following in `AddressTablePmo`:

. Create a void method `add` and annotate it with `@UIButton`.
. The attribute `variants` should be set to `{ButtonVariant.LUMO_CONTRAST}` and `icon` to `VaadinIcon.PLUS`.
. Annotate the method with `@SectionHeader`. This puts the button in the header of the section, next to the caption.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.AddressTablePmo.java
[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/table/AddressTablePmo.java[tags=addButton]
----

==== Showing a notification

To make sure the button works correctly, you will display a notification when clicking on it. To do so, implement the `add` method with `NotificationUtil.showInfo("New Address", "This button adds an address")`. The first argument is the title of the notification, the second is the content.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.AddressTablePmo.java
[source, java]
----
public void add() {
    NotificationUtil.showInfo("New Address", "This button adds an address");
}
----

If you run your application now, you should see a plus icon next to the title "Addresses". When you click on it, a notification box should pop up with the title "New Address" and its content should be "This button adds an address".

The <<tutorial-step-9,next step>> extends the UI so that the plus button adds a new address.
