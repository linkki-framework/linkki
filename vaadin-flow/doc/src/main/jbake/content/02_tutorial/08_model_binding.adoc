=== Step 6: Filling the AddressPage with Model Binding

[NOTE]
This step introduces you to the concept of "Model Binding". You will also learn how to style buttons with `ButtonVariant` and change the size of a table column with `@UITableColumn`.

The next step is to create and fill out the page that will display all addresses of a given partner in a table.

.AddressPage
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/address_initial.png[]

First, you need to implement the table. Create the row PMO of the table and call it `AddressRowPmo`.

==== Model Binding Theory

At this point, you already know how to use getters and setters. However, as you may have seen before, the more UI elements you use, the longer the PMO becomes, and the methods often only contain a delegation to the corresponding methods in the model object. To simplify the code in this case, linkki provides a mechanism called <<domain-model-binding, Model Binding>>.

[NOTE]
"Model Binding", shorthand for Domain Model Binding, is a *linkki* feature for reducing delegate code in PMO classes. It can be used when the presentation model and the domain model have similar structure and properties.

Basically, *linkki* will create the getters and the setters for you, based on already existing methods in a so-called *_Model Object_* and an attribute called *_modelAttribute_*. For example, if you use a `BusinessPartner` as the model object and set `modelAttribute = "dateOfBirth"` in the `@UIDateField` annotation, *linkki* will generate the getter and the setter of the `UIDateField` element for the property `dateOfBirth`.

[TIP]
Note that you still need to write a method and annotate it with e.g. `@UIDateField`. However, the method won't be executed, so its return type can be `void` and the method can be empty.

==== Model Binding Practice

You can now apply the theory by using model binding in the `AddressRowPmo`. Take a look at the <<tutorial-domain-model>> and implement it as follows:

. Create and implement a getter method for the property `address` with the signature `Address getAddress()`.
. Annotate it with `@ModelObject`. 
. Create an empty method with the signature `public void street()`.
. Annotate it with `@UITextField`. The label should be set to "Street" and the model attribute should be set to "street".
. Create an empty method with the signature `public void streetNumber()`.
. Annotate it with `@UITextField`. The label should be set to "Number" and the model attribute should be set to "streetNumber".
. Create an empty method with the signature `public void postalCode()`.
. Annotate it with `@UITextField`. The label should be set to "Postal Code" and the model attribute should be set to "postalCode".
. Create an empty method with the signature `public void city()`.
. Annotate it with `@UITextField`. The label should be set to "City" and the model attribute should be set to "city".
. Create an empty method with the signature `public void country()`.
. Annotate it with `@UITextField`. The label should be set to "Country" and the model attribute should be set to "country".

The finished implementation should look like this:

.AddressRowPmo.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/dialog/AddressPmo.java[tags=modelBinding1]
    public AddressRowPmo(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }
include::{source-dir}/pmo/dialog/AddressPmo.java[tags=modelBinding2]
----

==== Adding a delete button and styling it using `ButtonVariant`

The next step is to add delete buttons to the rows, so that the user is able to delete addresses. Note that you will implement the delete method itself in the address page later.

Even if the delete buttons are in a table, the implementation stays the same and is done in the row PMO class as follows:

. Create a new field `deleteConsumer` of type `Consumer<Address>`.
. Create a new method with the signature `public void deleteButton()` and implement it the same way as in <<tutorial-search-button,Step 1>>.
. Annotate it with `@UIButton`:
.. Adorn the button with a trash icon by setting:
... The attribute `captionType` to `CaptionType.NONE`.
... The attribute `showIcon` to `true`.
... The attribute `icon` to `VaadinIcon.TRASH`.
.. Style the button by setting the attribute `variants` to `{ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY, ButtonVariant.LUMO_SMALL}`. Just like the icon, the `ButtonVariant` is a https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/components/button[Vaadin component].

The finished implementation should look like this:

.AddressRowPmo.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/table/AddressRowPmo.java[tags=deleteButton]
----

==== Implementing the Container Pmo

Now that the row PMO has been implemented, create and implement the `ContainerPMO` called `AddressTablePmo` the same way as in <<tutorial-container-pmo,Step 2>> and set the caption of `@UISection` to "Addresses".

[TIP]
Don't forget to pass the `Consumer<Address>` to the constructor.

==== Creating and implementing the address page

Create and implement the address page as follows:

. Create a new `AbstractPage` called `AddressPage`, initialize it as you did in <<tutorial-search-page, Step 1>>.
. Create and implement the method `deleteAddress` that takes an `Address` as argument and delete it using the method `BusinessPartner.removeAddress`.
. Add the `AddressTablePmo` in the `createContent` method. Use the method `BusinessPartner.getAddresses()` to get the addresses of a partner.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.AddressPage.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
    private final BusinessPartner partner;
    
    @Override
    public void createContent() {
        addSection(new AddressTablePmo(partner::getAddresses, this::deleteAddress));
    }
    
include::{source-dir}/page/AddressPage.java[tags=deleteAddress]
----

==== Updating `PartnerDetailsView`

Finally, update `PartnerDetailsView` to add the `AddressPage` the same way as in <<tutorial-basic-data-page,Step 5>> by modifying the method `createAddressPage`.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.PartnerDetailsView.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/view/PartnerDetailsView.java[tags=createAddressPage]
----

==== Changing the columns' width with `@UITableColumn`

If you run your application, you will notice that the button column looks too wide compared to the other columns:

.AddressPage
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/address_delete_width_not_changed.png[]

To resize a column, go to `AddressRowPmo`, use the annotation <<ui-tables, `@UITableColumn`>> in addition to `@UIButton` and set the attribute `width` to e.g. 50.

The finished implementation should look like this:

.AddressRowPmo.java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
@UITableColumn(width = 50)
@UIButton(...)
...
----

Now you should see that the last column is much narrower than before:

.AddressPage
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/address_initial.png[]

The <<tutorial-step-7, next step>> extends the UI to make the addresses non-editable.
