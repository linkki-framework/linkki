=== Step 9: Implementing dialogs

[NOTE]
This step teaches you how to implement dialogs.
You will also learn how to reuse an existing PMO.

Now, we will implement the actual functionality of the add button, to add new addresses.
When the user clicks on the add button, they will be prompted to enter the address data in a dialog.
The entry will be added when the user finishes editing by clicking on the OK button.

.Add Address dialog

==== Reusing a PMO

The content of the dialog should be the same as `AddressRowPmo` without the delete button.
To avoid writing the same PMO twice, reuse it as follows:

. Extract a super class from `AddressRowPmo` such that it contains everything except the delete button and the consumer and call it `AddressPmo`.
. Annotate `AddressPmo` with `@UISection` and make sure the constructor has an `Address` argument that is assigned to the field `address`.

The finished implementations of `AddressRowPmo` and `AddressPmo` should look like this:

.AddressRowPmo.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/table/AddressRowPmo.java[tags=rowAfterExtraction]
----

.AddressPmo.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/dialog/AddressPmo.java[tags=addressPmo]
----

==== Implementing the dialog

Now, we add a new class `AddAddressDialogPmo`, which inherits from <<uiOpenDialogButton, `DialogPmo`>>.
It wraps around our `AddressPmo` and provides dialog functionalities such as validation, method invocation when OK is pressed and setting a dialogs caption.
Implement it as follows:

. Add a constructor with parameter `Consumer<Address> saveAddress` and store the value in a field.
. Create a new field of type `AddressPmo` and call it `contentPmo`.
. In the constructor, create a new `Address` and use it to create a new `AddressPmo`, which is stored in `contentPmo`.
. Override the method `getCaption` and return "Add Address".
. Override `getOkHandler` and return a lambda function without input parameters and calling `saveAddress#accept` on the `contentPmo`Â´s address.
. Override `getContentPmo` and return `contentPmo`.

The finished implementations of `AddAddressDialogPmo` should look like this:

.AddAddressDialogPmo.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/dialog/AddAddressDialogPmo.java[tags=addAddressDialogPmo]
include::{source-dir}/pmo/dialog/AddAddressDialogPmo.java[tags=addAddressDialogPmo_end]
----

Now, switch to the `AddressPage`.

. Create a new method `addAddress` with an input parameter `address` of type `Address`.
. Add the `address` to the `partner`.
. Save the changed `partner` in the `partnerRepository`.
. In `createContent` add `this::addAddress` to the input parameters of `AddressTablePmo`

The finished implementation should look like this:

.AddressPage.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/page/AddressPage.java[tags=createContent]
include::{source-dir}/page/AddressPage.java[tags=addAddress]
----

Finally, switch to `AddressTablePmo` to create the button that opens the dialog.

. Add a new constructor parameter `createConsumer` of type `Consumer<Address>` and assign it to a new field.
. Rename the `add` method to `getAddAddressDialogPmo` and let it return an element of type `DialogPmo`.
.. Return a new instance of `AddAddressDialogPmo` using the `createConsumer`.
.. Delete the `@UIButton` annotation.
.. Annotate the method with `BindIcon(VaadinIcon.PLUS)`.
.. Annotate the method with `@UIOpenDialogButton` setting the position to 10 and using `CaptionType.NONE`.

[NOTE]
There are alternatives for opening a <<dialogs, Dialog>>.
However, using <<uiOpenDialogButton, `@UIOpenDialogButton`>> is the preferred way for creating dialogs on button press.

.AddressTablePmo.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/pmo/table/AddressTablePmo.java[tags=createConsumer]

include::{source-dir}/pmo/table/AddressTablePmo.java[tags=getAddAddressDialogPmo]
----

If you run your application and click on the add button, you should see a dialog with the same fields as the address table.
If you click on the button "OK", you should now see a new address in the table with the information provided in the dialog.

.Add Address dialog
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/dialog_initial.png[]

.New Address added
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/address_new_line.png[]

The <<tutorial-step-10,next step>> extends the UI such that an address cannot be added if a field is empty.
