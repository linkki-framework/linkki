=== Step 4: Adding a Search menu item

[NOTE]
This step teaches you how to add a simple menu item to the menu bar using `ApplicationMenuItemDefinition` to navigate to the view of your choice.

Going back manually to the `BusinessPartnerView` is pretty annoying. This is why you will add a menu item that will redirect you to the view whenever you want.

As you can see, there is a blue bar at the top of your web page. This is the so-called application menu. If you look into the class `BusinessPartnerConfig`, you can see a method called `getMenuItemDefinitions`. Currently, it returns an empty sequence, which is why your menu bar is empty.

.BusinessPartnerConfig.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Override
public Sequence<ApplicationMenuItemDefinition> getMenuItemDefinitions() {
    return Sequence.empty();
}
----

To have the menu item redirect you to `BusinessPartnerView`, you need to return a non-empty sequence. To do this, add an instance of the *linkki* class called `ApplicationMenuItemDefinition` to `Sequence.of(...)`.

The `ApplicationMenuItemDefinition` needs three parameters:

. A name: "Search"
. An ID: "appmenu-search"
. A target view: `BusinessPartnerView.class`

.BusinessPartnerConfig.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{source-dir}/ui/BusinessPartnerConfig.java[tags=searchMenu]
----

If you open our application, you should now see a menu item called "Search" on the left of the blue bar, whether you are on `BusinessPartnerView` or `PartnerDetailsView`.
