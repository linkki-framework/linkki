== Getting Started

You can either add the required dependencies to an existing project or use one of the <<maven-archetypes,Maven archetypes>> to get started.

=== Maven dependencies

To create a *linkki* project, you need one of the following dependencies depending on the feature set you need:

.linkki-core
[source,xml]
----
include::{sample-parent-dir}/pom.xml[tags=linkki-core]
----

.linkki-vaadin-flow-component
[source,xml]
----
include::{sample-parent-dir}/pom.xml[tags=linkki-vaadin-flow-component]
----

`linkki-vaadin-flow-component` contains the following additional features:

* Sidebar layout

.linkki-application-framework
[source,xml]
----
include::{sample-parent-dir}/pom.xml[tags=linkki-application-framework]
----

`linkki-application-framework` contains the following additional features:

* Dialogs
* `LinkkiUi` with `ApplicationLayout` and `ApplicationConfig` as well as an adjusted theme
* UI Components to display validation messages


In addition to the *linkki* dependency, a *linkki* application with Vaadin may require a Vaadin Spring Boot starter.

=== Initial project structure

image::{images}{images-folder-name}/app_structure.png[]

`BusinessPartner`:: A spring specific class which allows our project to be run as a Java application. This class will not be found in the plain archetype.

`BusinessPartnerInfo`:: Defines basic information about our *linkki* application.

`BusinessPartnerConfig`:: Provides an instance of our `BusinessPartnerInfo` class and provides `ApplicationMenuItemDefinition` items to create an `ApplicationMenu` for the `ApplicationHeader`.

`BusinessPartnerLayout`:: Uses the `BusinessPartnerConfig` class to provide information for our application.

`HelloPmo`:: Defines a section on the webpage which is used in the UI of the application. You can apply annotations like `@UITextfield` to your methods to create specific UI elements. For more information about creating a UI see <<ui-element, UI elements>>.

`BusinessPartnerPage`:: Allows displaying and editing data in a certain layout and can consist of so called sections defined with multiple PMOs.

`BusinessPartnerView`:: Defines the entrypoint of a our main page.
