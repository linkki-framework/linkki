The Vaadin version update brings some notable changes that affect linkki applications:

* Testbench: The method `WebElement#getAttribute` is deprecated and should be replaced with `WebElement#getDomAttribute`.

==== Integration of linkki-f10 functionality into linkki

`linkki-f10` is a library created by Faktor Zehn that provided additional linkki functionalities that are commonly used in Faktor Zehn products, but are not open source.
With this version, classes in `linkki-f10` are fully integrated into linkki, making the code and documentation available at one place.

As part of this transition, all classes in the `linkki-f10` module have been deprecated and replaced by corresponding functionality in the other modules of `linkki`.
While this change requires action from most users, the migration mainly contains renaming of the packages in import.

In addition to the changes in code, the documentation is now also moved to according sections at link:https://doc.linkki-framework.org[doc.linkki-framework.org].
During this process, the documentation of the affected components has been reworked.

===== Migration

Most notable changes:

* Functionality previously contained in the `linkki-f10-search` module has been integrated into the new <<linkki-search, `linkki-search-vaadin-flow`>> module.
* The classes `F10ProductTheme`, `BoardComponent`, `BoardLayout`, `UIMenuList`, `UIMenuButton`, and `HierarchicalTableUtil` have been moved to `linkki-core-vaadin-flow`.
* The classes `InfoTool`, `InfoToolsComponent`, `HasBrowserConfirmation`, and `NavigationWorkaround` have been moved to `linkki-application-framework-vaadin-flow`.
* The functionality of `CommonApplicationHeader` was incorporated into <<application-header, `ApplicationHeader`>> and the newly introduced <<useraware-application-header,`UserAwareApplicationHeader`>>. Replace `CommonApplicationHeader` with `UserAwareApplicationHeader` if a user menu is needed and with `ApplicationHeader` otherwise.

==== UI Annotations and Aspects

[api-change]
===== Aspects with asynchronously loaded values

It is now possible to create custom aspects that load values asynchronously with a `CompletableFuture`.
The documentation for creating custom aspects is extended with a <<aspect-async,how-to guide for creating custom future aware aspects>>.

Additionally, the frontend behaviors of `UILabel` and `@UITableComponent` considering loading have been unified.
This leads to following breaking changes in the frontend:
* During loading, the `items-loading` (UITableComponent) / `value-loading` (UILabel) attributes are no longer set.
Instead, the attribute `content-loading` is set.
* The `has-errors` attribute has been renamed to `has-loading-error`.
* The CSS property `error-messages` has been renamed to `loading-error-message`.
* `@UILabel` components in a loading state no longer have the CSS class `loading`.

Custom CSS selectors that utilize the above attributes / CSS Properties must be adjusted accordingly.

===== UIHeadline
A new UI component, `@UIHeadline`, is now available, providing a way to easily create <<headline, headlines>> that only display text.

===== UIMenuList and UIButton
New UI components, `@UIMenuList` and `@UIMenuButton`, are now available, providing a way to create <<ui-menulist, buttons in menus>> that can expand a menu list or execute an action, while maintaining a consistent look and feel.

==== Other Improvements

* *New documentation chapter - How-To* +
Introduced a <<linkki-howto, How-To>> chapter containing coding examples and best practises.

* *Relocation of UINestedComponent* +
`UINestedComponent` has been moved from `linkki-core-nestedcomponent-vaadin-flow` to `linkki-core-vaadin-flow`. The module `linkki-core-nestedcomponent-vaadin-flow` has been removed.

* *Conditions for AssertJ* +
The utility class <<component-conditions, `ComponentConditions`>> providing UI specific conditions for AssertJ has been added to `linkki-vaadin-flow-test` to support writing more readable assertions.

* *Component Tree Representation* +
A new representation class, `ComponentTreeRepresentation`, has been added to provide a more expressive representation of components in AssertJ assertions.

* *Added Functionality in KaribuUtils* +
`KaribuUtils#getTextContent` now also returns the text content of layout elements. Additionally, the component tree can now be returned without printing it using `KaribuUtils#getComponentTree`.

==== Bugfixes
// https://jira.faktorzehn.de/browse/LIN-4248
* `SimpleItemSupplier` now throws a NullPointerException if the model object to PMO mapping supplier returns null
