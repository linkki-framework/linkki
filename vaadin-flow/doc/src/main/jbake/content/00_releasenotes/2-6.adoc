// https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-4104
Missing client event in custom fields::
Due to a Vaadin bug in custom fields (https://github.com/vaadin/web-components/pull/8368) in some cases the new value that was entered was not sent to the server and therefore not saved in the PMO.

=== Version 2.6.2

The following versions have been updated:

[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Faktor-IPS                | 24.7.5.release

// https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3970
===== Automatically focus first applicable element in combobox

If a character or word is entered into a combobox and there is only one matching element, then this element gets selected automatically.

Example::
A combobox has the values UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
+
If the user enters 'u', the entry UP is selected automatically.
+
If the user enters 't', there are two possible matches (LEFT and RIGHT) and therefore no entry is selected automatically.

==== Bugfixes

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3879
* Previously, setting the value to `null` in `@UIRadioButtons` failed to check the appropriate radio button.
Now, selecting `null` correctly checks the "Not specified" radio button, ensuring proper representation.
+
[WARNING]
====
With this bug fix, the converter must now be able to handle null-valued presentation values.
Although this was already part of the `Converter` contract, it can now lead to an exception in `ValueAspectDefinition`.

| Vaadin                    | 24.4.4
|===

==== Bugfixes

// https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3880
* Card sections theme now only applies to dialogs if the theme is explicitly set on the dialog itself or a child layout.
// https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3884
* The items of a table created with `@UITableComponent` are now only fetched asynchronously if the return type is `CompletableFuture`.
The <<ui-table-component, documentation>> is updated accordingly.

// https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3034
Disabled and readonly style for radio button and checkbox::
The disabled and readonly style of radio buttons and checkboxes has been harmonised to follow the linkki style guidelines.

// https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3868
`DefaultCaptionProvider` uses the provided `Locale`::
If the provided `Locale` is `null`, it defaults to `UiFramework.getLocale()`.
It does not ignore the provided `Locale` for `Boolean` captions anymore.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3899
Scrollbar on required components with an empty/ blank label::
Components within a form layout that are required and have an empty/ blank label do not scroll anymore.
The required indicator is always visible at the right upper corner of the label.

|===

The new Vaadin version brings some notable improvements and changes that affect linkki applications:

Using React components from Flow::
React components can now be easily used in Vaadin Flow applications.
Details are described in the link:https://vaadin.com/docs/next/flow/integrations/react[Vaadin documentation].

Improvements for Checkbox::
Checkboxes can now display validation messages also display required indicator in layouts other than `@UISection`.
For more information, check out the https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/components/checkbox[Vaadin documentation for checkbox].

// https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3816
Breaking Change in Vaadin Testbench::
The method `ElementQuery.id(...)` will now throw an exception if multiple elements with the same id are present, instead of returning the first matching item.
+
.Migration
[IMPORTANT]
====
To switch back to the old behavior, you have to change the id(...) call to withId(...).first().
A better approach would be to first narrow the scope to ensure that the requested element only exists once within this scope.
====

Open tab in dev mode less often::
When Vaadin application is started in dev mode, it always opens a new tab in browser.
This quickly leads to many tabs opened in browser.
This behavior is now changed: a new tab is only opened if the server is restarted again after 30 minutes.
Otherwise, the browser tab is reused.
This duration can be modified, see https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/integrations/spring/configuration#launch-browser-in-development-mode[Vaadin documentation].

Relocation of `/frontend` and renaming of generated bundles::
Vaadin 24.4.3 uses `src/main/frontend/` directory as a default location of frontend resources, which is more natural for Maven projects.
Additionally, the generated bundles are now renamed from `dev-bundle` to `dev.bundle`.
+
.Migration
[IMPORTANT]
====
Existing non generated content in `/frontend` should be moved to the new location.

The `.gitignore` file may need to be adjusted too to accommodate the changes.
To make it easier to maintain the `.gitignore` in the future, a <<gitignore, new documentation>> is added which provides template for linkki projects.
====

Misleading warning during Maven build::
If there are no Hilla dependencies on the classpath, e.g. in JEE projects, the following warning may occur during the maven build:
+
[source,shell]
----
[WARNING] The 'configure' goal is only meant to be used in Hilla projects with endpoints.
----
+
This warning is a false positive because of a bug in Vaadin (https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/issues/2440[details]) and can be ignored.

Product build failure when using Spring Data JPA::
When using Spring Data JPA, exception may occur during the Maven production build using `build-frontend`, caused by a `ClassNotFoundException` for example for the class `ApplicationPublisherAware`.
This occurs particularly if the `@EnableJpaRepositories` annotation is on the same class as `@Theme` (https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/19616[details]).
+
.Migration
[IMPORTANT]
====
One possible workaround is to move the implementation of the `AppShellConfigurator` into a different class.
Alternatively, the annotation for Spring Data JPA such as `@EnabledJpaRepositories` can be moved to a separate configuration class.
====

Details on all changes can be found in the https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases/tag/24.4.3[Vaadin 24.4.3 release notes].

Additional dependencies in vaadin-springâ€“boot-starter::
The Maven dependency `vaadin-spring-boot-starter` now includes the Hilla dependency by default, which introduces several transitive dependencies such as Spring Security or Swagger.
Some of these dependencies may cause build issues.
+
.Migration
[IMPORTANT]
====
Explicitly include the necessary Spring Boot Starters and Vaadin Spring dependency `vaadin-spring` instead.
Alternatively, the Hilla dependency `com.vaadin:hilla` can be excluded from the `vaadin-spring-boot-starter` dependency.
====

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-1803
===== New BOM module for dependency management

The new linkki BOM module manages the versions and scopes of all linkki dependencies.

To use the BOM module, simply import the BOM dependency in the dependency management of your project.
Any version and scope configurations of linkki dependencies can then be removed.

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.linkki-framework</groupId>
    <artifactId>linkki-bom</artifactId>
    <version>2.6.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
----

// TABLES

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3541
===== New annotation for tables: @UITableComponent

A new UI component `@UITableComponent` is now available, providing a new way to create tables directly on a method instead of a class.

.Example usage of @UITableComponent
[source,java]
----
    @BindStyleNames(LumoUtility.Height.FULL)
    @BindPlaceholder("There are no rows available.")
    @UITableComponent(position = 0, rowPmoClass = PersonRowPmo.class)
    public List<PersonRowPmo> getRows() {
        return itemSupplier.get();
    }
----

If link:https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/advanced/server-push[server push] is enabled and and the return type is a `CompletableFuture`, the items of the table are set asynchronously.
This is particularly useful if the rows of the table must be retrieved form external systems.

This new annotation has several advantages comparing to the definition of tables using `ContainerPmo`/`SimpleTablePmo`:

* No PMO class is required to create a table.
This makes it easier to combine tables with other components in a layout.
* It is easy to style the table itself.
When using `ContainerPmo`, it is only possible to add style names to the section.
If the table itself has to be modified, the created component has to be cast to `GridSection` to retrieve the `Grid` component.
With `@UITableComponent`, styles names can be directly applied to the table by using `BindStyleNames`.

Further details can be found <<ui-table-component, in the documentation>>.

[NOTE]
====
`@UITableComponent` does not work with selection yet.
====

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3561
===== Multi-selection in tables

* The `BindTableSelection` now includes a new attribute called `selectionMode`.
Its default value is `Grid.SelectionMode.SINGLE`.
* A new interface `MultiSelectableTablePmo` has been added.
While `SelectableTablePmo` defines the necessary methods when the `selectionMode` is `Grid.SelectionMode.SINGLE`, so does the interface `MultiSelectableTablePmo` for when `selectionMode` is `Grid.SelectionMode.MULTI`.

Further information can be found in the <<ui-selectable-table,documentation>>.

// CONVERTERS

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3358
[role="api-change"]
===== Boolean support for `UIComboBox` and `UIRadioButtons`

* Booleans in `UIComboBox` and `UIRadioButtons` are now displayed with user-friendly text.
No additional caption provider needs to be set.
For more details, see documentation for <<ui-combobox, UIComboBox>> and <<ui-radiobuttons, UIRadioButtons>>.
* `UIYesNoComboBox` is deprecated and can be replaced with `UIComboBox`.

[role="api-change"]
===== Improvements in datatype conversion

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3726
New converters for `GregorianCalendar` and `Money`::
Converters have been added for `GregorianCalendar` and `Money` that make them usable with `String`-valued UI components such as `@UITextField`. +
The `StringToGregorianCalendarConverter` is integrated into the <<linkki-converter-registry, LinkkiConverterRegistry>> and can be used with `@UITextField` or `@UILabel` directly. +
`StringToMoneyConverter` has be added in the Faktor-IPS extension.
Its functionality is documented <<ips-converters, here>>.
This converter is not applied by default, thus have to be added to the converter registry if needed.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3726
Changed String format for `Date`:: In the previous version, `Date` values has been converted to String using the converter provided by Vaadin format, which displays a date as `Jan 12, 1952` in the English locale.
This behavior is not consistent with the presentation in `UIDateField`.
Thus, a new `StringToDateConverter` has been introduced which presents a date as `01/01/1952` in English, and `01.01.1952` in German.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3680
Improved behavior with overflowing integers::
Input values in a `@UIIntegerField` that exceed the maximum allowed integer do not overflow anymore.
Instead, an error is displayed and the field is reset to its previous valid input.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3680
Consistent naming for number converters::
The number converters have been deprecated and replaced with new ones that match the correct naming schema, using the presentation type first.
+
|===
| *Old class* | *New class*
| `FormattedNumberToStringConverter` | `FormattedStringToNumberConverter`
| `FormattedIntegerToStringConverter` | `FormattedStringToIntegerConverter`
| `FormattedDoubleToStringConverter` | `FormattedStringToDoubleConverter`
| `FormattedDecimalFieldToStringConverter` | `FormattedStringToDecimalConverter`
|===
+
[NOTE]
The converters are used by the corresponding UI annotations by default.
Changes are only necessary if `FormattedNumberToStringConverter` was extended.

// ASPECTS

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3293
[role="api-change"]
===== New VisibleType `INVISIBLE_IF_EMPTY`

A new enum value, `INVISIBLE_IF_EMPTY`, is now available in `VisibleType`.
When used, the `VisibleAspectDefinition` evaluates the linked method's output.
Components linked to this method will be hidden if the result is `null` or an empty `String`, enhancing UI cleanliness.
Further details can be found <<visible, in the documentation>>.

// STYLE

[role="api-change"]
//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3540
===== New visual for card like sections

*linkki* provides a theme `card-like-pages` that can make all contained sections have a card alike appearance by giving the content of sections a background color.
This theme makes `AbstractPage` component that contain sections appear more structured.

.card-like-pages theme in previous version
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/2-6_card-section_before.png[]

This theme has been reworked:

.Notable Changes
[IMPORTANT]
====
* The theme `card-section-pages` has been changed to `card-sections`.
* `card-sections` does not only apply to `AbstractPage` components, but to all components.
* The background of the theme does not only cover the content components, but the whole section.
+
.card-like-sections theme now
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/2-6_card-section_after.png[]
====

To reflect the changes, following constants have been renamed:

|====
| Class         | Old name  | New name
| LinkkiTheme   | VARIANT_CARD_SECTION_PAGES    | VARIANT_CARD_SECTIONS
| LinkkiSection     | CLASS_SECTION_STYLE_CARD  | THEME_VARIANT_CARD
|====

See <<section-theme-variants, section "Theme Variants">> for more details on how to use the theme variant.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3701
[role="api-change"]
===== Customizable position of the loading indicator

When using application header, the loading indicator has the same color as the header, making it effectively invisible.
To mitigate this problem, the loading indicator was moved to the bottom of the page by default.

The position of the loading indicator can be configured with two new css properties in the _linkki_ theme:

* --linkki-loading-indicator-top
* --linkki-loading-indicator-bottom

[IMPORTANT]
In de _linkki_ theme the loading indicator is configured to be displayed at the bottom of the page by default.

For more details see <<loading-indicator, loading indicator>>.

[role="api-change"]
// https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3541
===== Improvements for Karibu support

`KaribuUtils` has been extended to provide better support for unit testing linkki applications:

Support for push UI::
As the push functionality is provided by Atmosphere thus does not work out of the box with Karibu, the method `KaribuUtils.UI.push()` and `KaribuUtils.UI.push(UI)` can be used to flush the command queue manually.

Support for OkCancelDialog::
A new inner class `KaribuUtils.Dialogs` has be added to provide methods that makes it easy to interact with `OkCancelDialog`.

Improved support for Notification::
The methods for `Notification` are moved to an inner class `Notifications`.
Additionally, methods are added to retrieve the severity, description, and content components in the notification.

Support for fields::
The method `setValue` of `AbstractField` does not fire value change events, making it difficult to test if the PMO was correctly updated.
The new method `Fields.setValue` can be now used to mitigate this problem.

===== Improvements of the documentation

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-2932
New documentation for CSS custom properties in the linkki Theme::
linkki theme defines CSS custom properties which is the easiest way to customize the UI.
These are now documented in chapter <<css-custom-properties-linkki-theme, "Styling">>.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3824
New documentation for `.gitignore`::
A template `.gitignore` file is provided for linkki projects, making it more clear which Vaadin resources should not be included in Git.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3682
linkki tutorial in the documentation::
The linkki tutorial is now part of this documentation (see <<linkki-tutorial, Tutorial>>), making it easier to find.

===== Other
//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3671
* `BindVariantNames` now applies to all Vaadin components, expanding its functionality beyond its previous limitation to components that implemented HasTheme.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3567
* All Notifications (`info`, `warning` and `error`) now include a close button.
Additionally, the default duration for warning notifications has been increased to `6000 ms`.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3823
* A new constructor has been added to the `DefaultCaptionProvider` class that accepts a `Locale` parameter.

==== Bugfixes

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3674
===== Default Error Page Exception Handling

For better message handling in the `LinkkiErrorPage` a new `MessageException` was introduced.

* On receiving a `MessageException`, the error page shows the message of this exception in production as well as in development mode.
* On receiving any other exception:
** In development mode: a custom message or the exception message is shown to the user.
** In production mode: only a generic error message is shown to the user to hide any sensitive information.

Additionally logging for the thrown exception has been added. `MessageExceptions` are only logged if they contain a cause.
All other exceptions are logged anyways.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3512
===== Width of nested components

The width of nested components was fixed.
Any value that is set as `width` on `@UINestedComponent` is now only applied to the layout element.
The nested component itself gets a width of 100%.

In the following example the wrapping element of the `@UIVerticalLayout` gets a width of 50% but the `@UIVerticalLayout` itself has full width.

[source,java]
----
@UINestedComponent(position = 10, width = "50%")
public PersonPmo getPerson() {
    return new PersonPmo();
}

@UIVerticalLayout
class PersonPmo  {

    @UITextField(position = 10, label = "Firstname")
    public String getFirstname() {
        return "Max";
    }

    @UITextField(position = 20, label = "Lastname")
    public String getLastname() {
        return "Mustermann";
    }

}
----
