[role="api-change"]
===== Added `INVISIBLE_IF_EMPTY` to `VisibleType` (https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3293[LIN-3293])
A new enum value, `INVISIBLE_IF_EMPTY`, is now available in `VisibleType`. When used, the `VisibleAspectDefinition` evaluates the linked method's output. Components linked to this method will be hidden if the result is `null` or an empty `String`, enhancing UI cleanliness.
Further details can be found here <<visible>>.

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3561
===== Introduce Multi-Selection in tables
* The `BindTableSelection` now includes a new attribute called `selectionMode`. Its default value is `Grid.SelectionMode.SINGLE`.
* A new interface `MultiSelectableTablePmo` has been added.
While `SelectableTablePmo` defines the necessary Methods when the `selectionMode` is `Grid.SelectionMode.SINGLE`,
so does the interface `MultiSelectableTablePmo` for when `selectionMode` is `Grid.SelectionMode.MULTI`.

===== Other
//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3671
* `BindVariantNames` now applies to all Vaadin components, expanding its functionality beyond its previous limitation to components that implemented HasTheme.

==== Bugfixes

//https://jira.convista.com/browse/LIN-3674
===== Default Error Page Exception Handling

For better message handling in the `LinkkiErrorPage` a new `MessageException` was introduced.

* On receiving a `MessageException`, the error page shows the message of this exception in production as well as in development mode.
* On receiving any other exception:
** In development mode: a custom message or the exception message is shown to the user.
** In production mode: only a generic error message is shown to the user to hide any sensitive information.

Additionally logging for the thrown exception has been added. `MessageExceptions` are only logged if they contain a cause. All other exceptions are logged anyways.
