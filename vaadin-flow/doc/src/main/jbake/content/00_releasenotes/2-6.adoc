* A new exception `MessageException` has been introduced, which is designed to convey explicit messages to end users. Key highlights include:
** In production mode, generic messages are displayed and sensitive details are concealed to prevent exposure of technical information.
** In development mode, if a custom message is available, it is displayed; otherwise, the specific `MessageException` message is shown. This provides improved clarity and utility in error messages.
** `MessageException` supports an overloaded constructor with a cause, facilitating more detailed exception chaining and debugging insights in development mode.
