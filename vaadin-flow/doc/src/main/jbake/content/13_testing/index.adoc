== Testing

When creating user interface with linkki, most of the UI logic is written in PMOs that can be easily tested by unit tests. However, these unit tests cannot cover parts that use Vaadin components, or any routing logic.

For these purposes, there are two frameworks that can be used for automated testing: https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-testing[Karibu Testing] and https://vaadin.com/testbench[Vaadin TestBench]. linkki provides extensions for these framework to further simplify testing for common usages.
