[[headline]]
=== Headline

For every sheet it is useful to have a headline that describes the current content.
It natively has a headline caption and could be extended by subclasses.

[[uiHeadline]]
==== UIHeadline

You can use `@UIHeadline` to create a `Headline`, which comes in two variations:

UIHeadline with only a title::
If your headline should only consist of a title, then you can use `UIHeadline` and return the title as a String.
+
.UIHeadline with String as return type
[source,java]
----
@UIHeadline(position=10)
public String getHeadlineText() {
    return "MyHeadline";
}
----

UIHeadline with additional components::
If you need to add additional components to the title or the end of the headline, you may also return a `HeadlinePmo` in the annotated method.
A headline PMO consists of a title and two optional PMOs that define the additional components.
+
.UIHeadline with additional components
[source,java]
----
public void initializeHeadlinePmo() {
    this.headlinePmo = new HeadlinePmo("MyHeadline", new TitleComponentPmo(), new HeadlineEndPmo());
}

@UIHeadline(position=10)
public HeadlinePmo getHeadlinePmo() {
    return this.headlinePmo;
}
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Note that the additional PMOs are only evaluated initially. Thus, the PMO instance must remain the same to avoid confusions.

Toggle the visibility of components that are only available conditionally.
====

Alternatively, `HeadlinePmo` itself is annotated with a linkki annotation which makes it usable with `VaadinUiCreator#createComponent`. The created Headline can then be added to any Vaadin layout.

.HeadlinePmo with VaadinUiCreator
[souce,java]
----
VaadinUiCreator.createComponent(new HeadlinePmo("MyHeadline", new TitleComponentPmo(), new HeadlineEndPmo()), new BindingContext());
----

==== Headline Component

Alternatively, you can directly instantiate `Headline` and add the component to your content.

If you want the Headline's title to be updated dynamically, you can also bind it to a PMO.
To do so, create a PMO containing a corresponding getter method for `Headline#HEADER_TITLE`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/application/HeadlinePmo.java[tags=HeadlinePmo]
----

Then bind it with the headline:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/application/ReportListPage.java[tags=bind-headline]
----

To add additional components into the `<h2>` element holding the title, `Headline` provides the method `addToTitle(Component)`.
Components added via `addToTitle()` remain present when the title text is updated using `setTitle()`.
`Headline` uses `CompositeH2` internally, which in contrast to `H2` preserves children when setting the text.
However, `Headline` can also be initialized with a standard `H2` element if needed.
