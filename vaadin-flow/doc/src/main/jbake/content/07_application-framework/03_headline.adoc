=== Headline

For every sheet it is useful to have a headline that describes the current content.
It natively has a headline caption and could be extended by subclasses.

To use a `Headline`, simply instantiate and add the component to your content.

If you want the Headline's title to be updated dynamically, you can also bind it to a PMO.
To do so, create a PMO containing a corresponding getter method for `Headline#HEADER_TITLE`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/application/HeadlinePmo.java[tags=HeadlinePmo]
----

Then bind it with the headline:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/application/ReportListPage.java[tags=bind-headline]
----

To add additional components into the `<h2>` element holding the title, `Headline` provides the method `addToTitle(Component)`.
Components added via `addToTitle()` remain present when the title text is updated using `setTitle()`.
`Headline` uses `CompositeH2` internally, which in contrast to `H2` preserves children when setting the text.
However, `Headline` can also be initialized with a standard `H2` element if needed.

Alternatively, you can also use @UIHeadline for simple use cases without additional components:

[source,java]
----
@UIHeadline
public String getHeadlineText() {
    return "MyHeadline";
}
----
