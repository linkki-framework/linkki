=== Linkki Converter Registry

Typically, each UI component is designed to handle a specific data type. 
However, with the LinkkiConverterRegistry in linkki, developers can customize conversions between model data types and presentation types. 
This feature expands the capabilities of UI components to support a broader range of value types beyond their defaults.

==== Default Converters in LinkkiConverterRegistry

Following converters are used by default:

[cols = "2, 6"]
.Default Converters
|===
| Converter | Description

| `DateToLongConverter` | Calculates the number of milliseconds since `January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT`. `1000L` would be `Thu Jan 01 01:00:01 CET 1970` and vice versa.
| `DateToSqlDateConverter` | Calculates the number on milliseconds since `January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT` but in sql form. `1000L` would be `1970-01-01` and vice versa.
| `LocalDateTimeToDateConverter` | Converts `LocalDateTime` to `Date`. Makes it possible to use `Date` for UI components that uses `LocalDateTime`, such as <<ui-datetimefield, `@UIDateTimeField`>>.
| `LocalDateToDateConverter` | Converts `LocalDate` to `Date`. Makes it possible to use `Date` for UI components that uses `LocalDate`, such as <<ui-datefield, `@UIDateField`>>.
| `LocalDateToStringConverter` | Converts `LocalDate` to `String` using the locale specific format. Makes ot possible to use `LocalDate` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `LocalDateTimeToStringConverter` | Converts `LocalDateTime` to `String` using the locale specific format. Makes it possible to use `LocalDateTime` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToBigDecimalConverter` | Converts a `String` to a number of type `BigDecimal`. Makes it possible to use `BigDecimal` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToBigIntegerConverter` | Converts a `String` to a number of type `BigInteger`. Makes it possible to use `BigInteger` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToBooleanConverter` | Convert a `String` ("true" or "false") to `Boolean`. Makes it possible to use `Boolean` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToDateConverter` | Converts a `Date` to a `String` using the locale specific format similar to the one used by a Vaadin DatePicker. Makes it possible to use `Date` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToDoubleConverter` | Converts a `String` to a number of type `Double`. Makes it possible to use `Double` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToFloatConverter` | Converts a `String` to a number of type `Float`. Makes it possible to use `Float` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToIntegerConverter` | Converts a `String` to a number of type `Integer`. Makes it possible to use `Integer` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToLongConverter` | Converts a `String` to a number of type `Long`. Makes it possible to use `Long` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.
| `StringToGregorianCalendarConverter` | Converts `GregorianCalendar` to `String` and vice versa, taking locale-specific date formats into account. Makes it possible to use `GregorianCalendar` in `String`-valued components such as `@UILabel`.

==== Configuration

The converter registry is defined in the <<application-config, Application Configuration>>. 

The registry can be instantiated with additional converters which would be set before the default converters. If the registry is initiated with a custom converter which has the same types as an existing one, the custom converter is used with higher priority.
