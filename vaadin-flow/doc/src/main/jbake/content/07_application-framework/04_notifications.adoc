=== Notifications

Notifications can be created using `NotificationUtil`. It provides three types of notifications: info, warning and error.

Error notifications stay on the screen until the "Close" button is clicked.
Info and warning notifications close automatically after the configured duration in milliseconds, which can be set separately for info and warning also.
Each notification of the respective type has a "Close" button and will remain on the screen until this button is clicked or the set duration expires.

==== MessageList
When displaying a `MessageList`, the severity of the notification is equal to the maximum severity in the `MessageList`. Additionally, each message has an icon corresponding to its individual severity.
