=== InfoTool and InfoToolsComponent

An `InfoTool` represents a UI component with a caption that allows viewing or editing specific information. Each tool consists of a unique ID, a caption, and a main component.

The `InfoToolsComponent` manages multiple `InfoTool` instances and displays them as expandable sections (`com.vaadin.flow.component.details.Details`). It allows tools to be opened automatically based on URL parameters or predefined default tools. Changes to the tool's state, such as opening or closing, are reflected in the URL.
The UI updates dynamically when tools change, and CSS classes can be applied for customization.
