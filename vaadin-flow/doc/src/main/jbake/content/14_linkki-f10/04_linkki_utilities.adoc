====  Utility Class `HierarchicalTableUtil` for Vaadin `TreeGrid`

The utility class `HierarchicalTableUtil` can be used to customize a `TreeGrid` as follows:

* The items within a `TreeGrid` can be unfolded up to a configurable layer
* All items can be folded up again
* A filter can be used to exclude items given a condition

In general, `HierarchicalTableUtil` is most commonly used in places where `TreeGrid` is instantiated such as `AbstractPage` or Vaadin layouts such as `VerticalLayout`.

.Example for unfolding the first layer of items if they contain more than one child item
