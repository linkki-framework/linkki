[[ui-tables]]
=== Tables

The basics of table creation were already mentioned in the chapter <<binding-table, binding of a table>>. This section details the <<ui-row-pmo,definition of table structure>> and the <<ui-container-pmo, Container PMO>>.

[[ui-row-pmo]]
==== Definition of the Table Structure with a Row PMO
The structure of the table is defined in a PMO class, whose instances represent rows in the table. Thus, these classes are called "row PMOs".

Row PMO classes are standard PMOs, which do not represent sections and thus shouldn't be annotated with `@UISection`.

Here, the annotation <<ui-element,UI element>> defines the column in the table. A column showing the name of a contact, for instance, can be setup as follows:

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/pmo/ContactRowPmo.java[tags=contactRowPmo-labelBinding]
----

That means every property that was found in the row PMO class provided by the `ContainerPmo` is set up as a column. Every defined property specifies the setup of the column as well as the concrete field inside the table's cell. Next to all aspects that are provided by `@UITableColumn` it takes the label from the field definition.

IMPORTANT: The properties of a table column are described using the properties in the row PMO. But these properties cannot be bound to any specific row PMO instance (there might be none if the table is empty or many if there are multiple rows). Hence all bindings are directed to the row PMO class. That also means: If you want to <<nls-properties,translate a column label>> the key is created using the class name of the row PMO.

[[ui-table-column]]
===== @UITableColumn

By design all properties of a PMO are presented in the table. With the annotation `@UITableColumn` additional properties of a table column could be bound.

Column size::
You can use the properties `width` (in pixels) and `flexGrow` to modify the column size. The `flexGrow` specifies what amount of the available space inside the table the column should take up and grow (if resized), proportionally to the other columns. If `flexGrow` is set to 0, the column has a fixed `width`.

[[collapsible-columns]]
Collapsible columns::
The property `collapsible` can make a column collapsible, i.e. the user can toggle the visibility of a column. It also defines if a collapsible column should be initally collapsed.
+
This feature only works if the table is created inside of a <<layout-section, section>>. If there are any collapsible columns in the table, a right aligned header menu is displayed in the created section with which the user can toggle the visibility of a collapsible column.

NOTE: Setting the visibility of a column programmatically after the `GridSection` has already been created, should be done using `GridSection#setColumnVisible(String columnKey, boolean visible)` instead of `Grid#getColumnByKey()` to make sure, the checked state of its `MenuItem` is set correctly!

[[sortable-columns]]
Sortable columns::
The property `sortable` allows the column to be sorted. The type of the column value must implement `Comparable`, which defines the order in which the values are sorted.
+
WARNING: Model bindings (`modelAttribute`) can not be used with sortable columns, a getter method must be used.


Text alignment::
It is possible to customize text alignment inside of individual columns by setting the `textAlign` value of the `@UITableColumn` annotation. The alignment also applies to the header and footer of the column.

[[ui-container-pmo]]
==== Container PMO

In addition to a row PMO, a container PMO is needed to provide the row PMOs that should be rendered in the table. The container PMO can be optionally annotated with `@UISection` to display the table in a `TableSection`. For most cases, the standard implementation <<ui-simple-table-pmo,`SimpleTablePmo`>> can be used as super class.

[[ui-simple-table-pmo]]
===== SimpleTablePmo

Most commonly, the row PMO objects are converted from a list of model objects. In this case, the abstract class `org.linkki.core.defaults.columnbased.pmo.SimpleTablePmo<MO, ROW>` may be extended. It defines a constructor that requires the list or the supplier for the list of model objects. Additionally the method `createRow(MO)` needs to be implemented. This method simply takes a model object and creates a row PMO for it and is only called once for every model object. A simple example may look like this:

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/pmo/SimpleContactTablePmo.java[tags=simpleContactTablePmo]
----

The `SimpleTablePmo` is an abstract convenience implementation of the `ContainerPmo<ROW>` interface.

[[ui-container-pmo-interface]]
===== ContainerPmo Interface

In general, a container PMO have to implement the interface `ContainerPmo<ROW>`. The type parameter `ROW` is the row PMO class that defines the table structure.

The method `List<ROW> getItems()` is called by the `ContainerBinding` to add the elements to the table. It should always return the same instance of `List<ROW>` as long as the items do not change. The <<ui-simple-item-supplier, `SimpleItemSupplier`>> offers support for that.

By overriding the default method `int getPageLength()` the number of rows shown can be controlled. By default 15 rows are shown. It is a common practice to allow tables to 'grow' to a certain size and then limit the number of lines while also enabling the scrolling for the table. If `0` is returned the table grows dynamically with the content, without limit.

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/pmo/ContactTablePmo.java[tags=page-length]
----

The column structure of the table is determined by the <<ui-row-pmo, row PMO>> class, which is returned by the method `Class<? extends ROW> getItemPmoClass`. In the default implementation the class of the generic parameter `ROW` is returned. To support tables which are configured with other components for the cells, the method can be overwritten and return a subclass of `ROW`.

If the table should support the adding of items, the `default` method `Optional<ButtonPmo> getAddItemButtonPmo` must be overwritten. How a `ButtonPmo` is created is described in the chapter <<button-pmo, ButtonPmo>>.

[[ui-simple-item-supplier]]
===== SimpleItemSupplier

The `SimpleItemSupplier<PMO, MO>` is used to only create a new `List<PMO>`, if a row was changed. When using `ContainerPmo` interface directly, `SimpleItemSupplier` should be used if the displayed rows may change dynamically.

The instantiating is done with two parameters

* `modelObjectSupplier` of type `Supplier<List<MO>>` is called to access a list of the model objects
* `mo2pmoMapping` of type `Function<MO, PMO>` is called for the creation of a PMO for a model object

[[ui-hierarchical-table]]
==== Hierarchical Tables

Sometimes, the data in a table should be grouped for presentation, for example when summarizing values over certain categories. In that case, the data represents a tree-like structure with parent-child-relationships between rows. The resulting table will be a Vaadin `TreeTable` which allows collapsing and showing the child-rows of a row.

.Hierarchical table
image::{images}{images-folder-name}/treetable.png[A hierarchical table,align="center"]

This can be realized by using `org.linkki.core.defaults.columnbased.pmo.HierarchicalRowPmo<PMO>`, row PMOs that contain further rows as children. It is possible to use multiple subclasses for row PMOs, using `HierarchicalRowPmo` only for collapsible rows. To indicate that the table contains hierarchical rows, the <<ui-container-pmo,ContainerPmo>> should return `true` in the method `isHierarchical()`. By default, this method returns `true` if `getItemPmoClass()` returns a class that implements `HierarchicalRowPmo`, which means that all rows are collapsible.

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/treetable/fixed/SummarizingPersonRowPmo.java[tags=hierarchical-row-pmo]
----

If the order of the rows might change due to user input, you should use a <<ui-simple-item-supplier,`SimpleItemSupplier`>> as with the <<ui-container-pmo,`ContainerPmo`>> to avoid recreating the PMOs for unchanged rows.

----

[[ui-selectable-table]]
==== Row selection in Tables

By default, table rows are not selectable. If table row selection should be possible, the `ContainerPmo` implementation should also implement the interface `SelectableTablePmo`. This interface requires three methods:

* `ROW getSelection()`: returns the selected row
* `setSelection(ROW)`: sets the new selected row
* `onDoubleClick()`: executes action when a double click is made on the selected row. It is safe to assume that `setSelection(ROW)` is already called.

Note that it is not possible to nullify the selection once a row is selected.

[[ui-placeholder-table]]
==== Placeholder
The `@BindPlaceholder` annotation is utilized to provide a placeholder in tables when they are empty, enhancing the UI by informing users of the absence of items. Further details and behaviors are described in the <<placeholder, Placeholder Configuration section>>.

NOTE: For `@BindPlaceholder` applied to table PMOs, headers and footers are automatically hidden in empty tables. This is an inherited behavior; subclasses of an annotated class cannot override this aspect.


[[ui-table-footer]]
==== Table footer

By overriding the `default` method `getFooterPmo()` a footer row is generated. The implementation of the interface `TableFooterPmo` must implement the method `getFooterText(String column)`.

The parameter `column` is the ID of the column for which the text should be displayed. An example for this would be a sum of all items from a column.

[source, java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/playground/table/dynamicfields/CarTablePmo.java[tags=table-footer]
----

TIP: The `ContainerPMO` can be annotated with `@BindStyleNames` and `LinkkiApplicationTheme#GRID_FOOTER_BOLD` to make the table footer text bold. This is particularly useful for columns which have a footer to show the sum of numbers.
To make the column right aligned use the `textAlign` property of `@UITableColumn`.

[[button-pmo]]
==== ButtonPmo
Currently the <<ui-container-pmo, `ContainerPmo`>> provides a method `getAddItemButtonPmo()`, by which a plus button can be added besides the name of the table.
