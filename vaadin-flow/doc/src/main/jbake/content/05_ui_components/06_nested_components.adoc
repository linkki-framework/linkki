=== Nested Components

Methods annotated with `@UINestedComponent` can return a PMO, which is then included in the page.
The nested component is displayed as if it is a component.
If the nested component is a section, the nested component looks like it is further indented.

An example for this feature is pictured below, including relevant code snippets of the two classes.

==== Returning multiple nested PMOs

Instead of returning a single PMO, a method annotated with `@UINestedComponent` can also return a `SequencedCollection<Object>`.
Each element of the collection is treated as an individual nested component and displayed in the same order as in the collection.

This allows you to provide multiple nested components that should appear in sequence within the same parent component.

WARNING: The list of PMOs is not dynamically updated.
If certain nested components should only be displayed under specific conditions, they must be configured using `@BindVisible`.
