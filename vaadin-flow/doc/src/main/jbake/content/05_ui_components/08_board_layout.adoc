=== BoardLayout

NOTE: Dependency <<_linkki_vaadin_flow_component, `linkki-vaadin-flow-component`>> or <<_linkki_application_framework, `linkki-application-framework`>> is needed.

The `BoardLayout` is a *linkki* UI component that provides a dashboard-like responsive layout made of cards.

Each `BoardComponent` is created with a header, the contained Vaadin `Component` and optionally a variant to customize how much space the card can assume.
There is also the option of creating BoardComponents using PMOs with `BoardComponent::withPmo`.
Board elements can be added to the `BoardLayout` within the constructor and by calling `add(BoardComponent... components)`.
