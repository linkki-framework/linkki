=== Location of Resource Bundles

The translations used by the PMO NLS service must be located in the project's resource folder, mirroring the path of the used PMO. For example:

.An example of a NLS folder structure
image::{image-dir}/nlsFolderStructure.png[]

In this example, NLS Strings in `org.linkki.samples.binding.pmo.ButtonsSectionPmo` that need to be translated must be defined in `org.linkki.samples.binding.pmo.linkki-messages.properties`.

These `.properties` files contain messages in text form, each file represents one supported language for the PMOs in the same folder. It's important that these files share the base name `linkki-messages`. A file with the base name has to be present in the resource folder and acts as fall back option if no specific `.properties` file is found for a locale. You can support as many languages as you want by simple adding another `.properties` file to the resource folder, its name consisting of the base name and the language code separated by `_`. As shown in the example above, the German translations are represented by the file `linkki-messages_de.properties`. Note that each of these files has to contain the same items, but translated for the language they represent.

=== Translatable PMO Properties

All aspects containing String values can be translated. Frequently used examples are label, caption and tooltip. Section captions can also be translated.
For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/java/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/pmo/ChildrenSectionPmo.java[tags=sectionCaption]
----

With its German translation entry in `linkki-messages_de.properties`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/resources/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/pmo/linkki-messages_de.properties[tags=sectionCaption]
----
String valued aspects such as placeholder or caption do not have a property name. In this case, the pattern for the key would be PmoClassName__aspectName. For convenience, the second underscore can be omitted, i.e. the pattern PmoClassName_aspectName can also be used. If both keys happen to be present, the pattern with two underscores has a higher precedence.

=== Predefined Key Structure for *linkki* PMO

An entry for a translation in the `linkki-messages.properties` files consists of two parts: The "key" that identifies a localizable aspect of a PMO property and the text, seperated by `=`.
The key is a String that consists of the PMO's class name, the name of the PMO property and the localizable aspect of the property, separated by `_`. The `linkki-messages.properties` file from the picture above looks like this:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/resources/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/pmo/linkki-messages.properties[tags=properties]
----

The last entry of the above `.properties` file points to the PMO `ContactRowPmo`, and provides an English translation for the label of its property `name`:

[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/java/org/linkki/samples/playground/binding/pmo/ContactRowPmo.java[tags=contactRowPmo-labelBinding]
----

NOTE: *linkki* always tries to retrieve a value from the `linkki-messages.properties`, if the file exists. That means that the label "Name" that is defined directly in the annotation `@UILabel` above will not be used in this constellation. The entry `ContactRowPmo_name_label=name` overrides it as default value if there is no specific `.properties` file for the user's locale. It is useful to include the default label in the annotation to avoid having to look it up in the properties file when viewing the source code.

*linkki* will also look up NLS Strings of the superclasses of a class as well as implemented interfaces.
This lookup prioritizes the current class, followed by all of its superclasses, followed by
implemented interfaces and their superinterfaces.
