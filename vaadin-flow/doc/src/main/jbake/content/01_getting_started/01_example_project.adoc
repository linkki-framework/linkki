=== Example project

=== Goal

The goal is to create a simple user interface for reporting errors. The report should have a description and a type. The following types should be available:

* Bug
* Improvement
* Question

The report can only be submitted if a description has been entered and a type was selected.

image::{images}{images-folder-name}/report_enabled.png[]

NOTE: Persisting the report is *not* part of this tutorial.

=== Prerequisites

To start this project, you need

* Java 17 +
* your favorite Java IDE
* Maven
* a modern browser

Follow the steps described in <<getting-started, project setup>> to create a new *linkki* project.

=== Step 1: Domain Model

First, we create a model to describe the domain. The model consists of two classes, <<report, `Report`>> and <<report-type, `ReportType`>>. These classes do _not_ receive any UI specific annotations.

.Report
[[report]]
[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/model/Report.java[tags=report]

    // getters and setters
}
----

.ReportType
[[report-type]]
[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/model/ReportType.java[tags=report-type]
----

NOTE: `ReportType` implements the method `getName()`. This method is called by *linkki* to display the 'caption' for the enum values.

=== Step 2: PresentationModelObject (PMO)

Our UI should show a text area to enter a description. For the selection of the report type, a combo box with the enum constants of the `ReportType` should be displayed. To submit the report, we also require a `Send` button. This button should only be active if a description has been entered and a type was selected.

Starting off, we first create a new class in the package `org.linkki.samples.gettingstarted.pmo`, naming it `ReportSectionPmo`. This class should be annotated with `@UISection`.

In addition, the class needs an instance variable to store the <<report, `Report`>>, which must be passed to the constructor.

.ReportSectionPmo
[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=report-pmo]

    ...
----

For the model binding to work, a getter method for the report must be created and it must be annotated with `@ModelObject`.

.@ModelObject
[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=model-binding]
----

Now we define the text area and the combo box. Each of these UI elements needs a method, annotated with `@UITextArea` and `@UIComboBox` respectively. The UI anontations must define the properties `position` and `label`, as well as `modelAttribute` which indicates which model property this field represents. These methods do not take any arguments nor need to return anything as the value will be taken from the domain model directly.

.TextField and ComboBox
[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=textfield]

include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=combobox]
----

IMPORTANT: The annotations must always be added to the methods, not the fields of the class.

The last step is the definition of the button. This requires a method with no arguments and return value that is annotated with `@UIButton`. The content of the method will be invoke upon clicking the button.

As a special feature, the button should be activated or not depending on the values in the model. This is determined via the property `enabled = EnabledType.DYNAMIC` in the UI annotation.

By setting `EnabledType.DYNAMIC`, *linkki* searches for a method `boolean isSendEnabled()`. It is called automatically during the update of the UI. Its return value determines the activation state of the button.

IMPORTANT: The method name _must_ conform to the convention is[NameOfThePropertyBelongingToTheAnnotatedMethod]Enabled(). The method must be public and return a boolean value.

.Button
[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=button]
----

=== Step 3: Vaadin UI

The UI contains "only" the section for the creation of the report.

The first part is "normal" Vaadin code. The interesting *linkki* parts start at `(2)`. The PMO is passed as parameter to the method `VaadinUiCreator#createComponent`, as well as a <<binding-basics, `BindingContext`>>.  At last, the created `section` must now be set as `content` of the UI.

.UI
[source,java]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/GettingStartedUI.java[tags=ui-class]
----
<1> Standard Vaadin code
<2> *linkki* specific code

=== Starting the Application

The application can be started from the command line via

[source,bash]
----
$> mvn spring-boot:run
----

and is then reachable at http://localhost:8080/linkki-getting-started.
